So the responder gets psi 1 and psi 2.

He wants to check if they're equal.

So do you know how to check whether two quantum states are
equal?

Yeah?
If they overlap.
Right, but how do you do that with a quantum circuit?
Measure it?
Actually, that's not.

You've seen this.
So psi 1--
I'll draw the quantum circuit, and then someone
can tell me what this is.
0 plus 1 psi 1 psi 2.

Well, what we want to do is we want to do a controlled swap,
and then I a Hadamard, and then a measurement.

So we want to know whether they're equal,
and if they're equal, then when we do the controlled swap,
the state does not change, and 0 plus 1 over 2 turns into 0.
So this is 0 with probability 1/2--

or with 1-- probability 1.

And here it's going to be 0 with probability less than 1.
So do you remember the swap test?
Yeah.

So the state after the swap test is going to be 0 psi 1 psi 2
plus 1 psi 2 psi 1 over root 2.

And now we want to know what the overlap of that
is with 0 plus 1 over root 2.
And this is the probability that we measure 0.
So that is just the amplitude of 1/2 1 plus psi 1 psi 2
psi 2 psi 1 squared, because when
you take the inner product of this--

you're going to get psi 1 psi 2 plus psi 2 psi 1
when you take this inner product.
And then there are two kinds of terms.
There's psi 1 psi 2 squared, which is 1,
and psi 2 times psi 2 psi 1, which is this term.
So when you add them all up, you get this, and this was--
what was it?
It was at most 29/30, so this is 0 with probability less than--

well 29/30 plus 1 is 59/30.
Divide by 2.
You get 59/60, so this is 59/60 squared.

So there's a significant difference between these two
things, and if you repeat the test
by sending lots of state psi 1 and psi 2,
the responder can check--

can do this test many times.
And eventually he will get this number down to as small
as he wants.
