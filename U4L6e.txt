The approximation we apply in order
to simulate this sum of two Hamiltonians
is [? the ?] Lie product formula,
which says that, in the limit, as I
take an infinite number of partitions of e
to the iH1t divided by n, e to the minus
iH2t divided by n, where I evolve
by the first Hamiltonian, for a small sliver of time,
t divided by n, then the second one for another small sliver
of time, repeat this many times, taking the slivers to become
smaller and smaller, this gives us
an equality which is the sum of the two Hamiltonians.
Now, this is a beautiful mathematical fact.
Unfortunately, when we do our actual simulation,
we have to truncate it at some point,
and errors start to pop in.
And when we truncate it at a certain point,
this method is called "Trotterization."

And this is often referred to as the "Trotter Suzuki formula"
or "expansion."
And I'll give that in its forms, with all the error bounds,
in just a moment.
