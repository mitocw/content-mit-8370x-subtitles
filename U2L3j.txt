If the function is 1 to 1, you end up with n linear equations
and--
good point.
c is all 0s.
c is-- you end up with n linear equations.
c is all 0s.
So really, you need to--
Yeah, so really what you need to do is you need to--

but actually you don't want to do that.
If c is all--
if the function is 1 to 1, you're
going to end up with a single value of c.
And now what you need to do is you need to go back and ask
is f of 0 equal to f of c.

If yes, then it's clearly 2 to 1.
And if no, it's 1 to 1.

Because if the function is 2 to 1,
you will never reach a point where you get--

no, n linearly independent y sub i's.
So if you don't get n linearly independent Y sub I's, you
don't know whether you were just unlucky
or whether the function was 1 to 1.
So the safest thing to do is go back and plug-in
f of 0 equals f of c.
That was a very good question.
Other questions?
Yeah.
And so-- so it means that the quantum magic from this
is all contained within the oracle, right?
Because everything else that we've done
might as well just be on [INAUDIBLE] levels.
But the [INAUDIBLE] all happens within when we call the oracle.
I think so, yeah.
I mean because what are we--
what would the gate structure look like?
So we started with plus, plus, plus.

And now we compute f of x, and maybe I
should have put 0s here, and we get f of x.
And we get, I guess this thing is x.
And then we do lots of Hadamards And we
don't do anything to this.

And finally, we measure.

So if we didn't have this f of x in here,
well, you can think of these pluses
as just being 0s with a Hadamard on them.

If we didn't have this f of x, then we
would be doing a Hadamard and undoing a Hadamard
and we wouldn't get anything.
So the magic comes when f of x--
when we take this oracle and compute f of x down here.
And we haven't changed any of the bit
values on this register, but we've changed their--
we've changed their base structure when we--
back fraction from here to here.

And that lets us do the magic.
OK.
So, I mean the Hadamards are certainly very important in--
Yeah.
--making the algorithm work.
Yeah.
But the entanglement that makes--
I mean, you can't do quantum computation
without entanglement.
And all the entanglement comes from this step.
Right.
