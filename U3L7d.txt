So first, Alice and Bob use error-correcting code.

Code.
Let's call it C to make sure they agree.

And how do they do this?
Well, Alice has a string of bits, b,
and Bob has a string of bits, b plus e.

And we'd, like this e--
we'd like this somehow to turn into correcting an error
with an error-correcting code.
So Alice chooses a random c in C.
So she chooses a random code word in C,
and she computes b plus c and sends this to bob.
And Bob can now--

and I want to say Bob adds b plus c and b plus e.
Let's just write this out.

Equals c plus c.
So Alice has c.
Bob-- well, this is a error-correcting code
with a small error added.
We can correct it.
So Bob computes c.
And now, what does Bob do?

Well Bob has b plus e, he has c plus e, and he has c.
If you add all those together, you get b.

c plus e plus c is equal to b.
So Bob can get Alice's bit string from Alice's bit string.
And what did Alice do?
She took her error-correcting code
and ran it, added a random bit in the error-correcting code
to get to b to get c.
So I want a claim that doesn't leak any information to Eve.
Or rather it does, but doesn't leak very much.

So basically it leaks the--

it leaks the co-set of C that b is in.

So let's say C is 2 to the k code words.

They still have k random bits because they agree on C.
And C isn't the code, so they have 2
to the k possible messages.
So maybe I should have said, they--
Bob can compute c and Alice knows c,
so maybe C is their random string.

OK.
So they agree on 1 of 2 to the k messages.
And because b was totally random,
b plus c doesn't tell anything to Eve.
Rather, it tells her what co-set of c b is in,
but it doesn't tell anything about which code
word in our error-correcting code they agreed on.
So you still have k random bits because they
agree on a code word in C.
