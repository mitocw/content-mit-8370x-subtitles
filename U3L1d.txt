So what we're going to be doing in the next section
is quantum error correction and quantum error correcting codes,
and a bunch of other stuff.
So what I'd like to do is I'd like
to start with a little overview of classical error correcting
codes, because quantum error correction codes are just
classical error correction codes quantumized,
kind of like the quantum fourier transform
with a discreet fourier transform quantumized.
So I want to talk about errors.

In information theory, they're called messages,
but they might be a movie, or they might be a song,
or they might be something else.
And you have a DVD player.
And if you take a DVD and you scratch it,
you're destroying some of the bits on it.
But then you take this DVD and you stick it
in your DVD player--
miraculously, despite the fact that you've
destroyed a bunch of the bits on it,
it still works, unless you scratched it a lot,
in which case it stops working.

That's because the DVD is encoded
with a classical error correcting code
and it corrects errors.

I think I want to start with the first error correcting
code that exists.
But first, I'll tell you a little story.
In the 19th century, ships went around with chronometers.
And the reason they all had chronometers,
and these were very important, is you have a globe here.
If you can figure out your latitude
by looking at the stars and, well,
you can see how far from the horizon the North Pole is.
But how do you figure out longitude?

Yeah?
Compare the local time to a constant time reference?

So you know the sun is supposed to rise at your latitude,
and that's local time.
So compare sunrise with a clock.
But you need a really, really, really, really good clock
to do this, because if you're off at a voyage
and it takes months, and your clock loses or gains
several minutes, then you're really
are not sure where you are, in terms of this.

So as I say, you need a very good clock.
So there's this book called Longitude
by Dava Sobel that tells about how this one man--
so the British government put out a prize
of some huge number of pounds, back in those days,
for constructing a way of determining longitude.
And this guy spent his entire life
developing an accurate chronometer.

And it took him an enormous struggle to get the money.
And actually, the chronometers that ended up being used
were developed by some guy in France
that used some of this guy's ideas
and some of their own ideas and developed accurate
chronometers, which by 1800--
I think that's 50 years after, I forgot his name, lived--

they started putting them on ships.
But a ship always carried three chronometers.
Can you tell me why?

So why don't you just carry one chronometer?
Yeah?
If one of them is faulty, you can take the majority.
Yeah.
If you have two, and one of them says 8:35
and the other says 8:55, you don't know which one's right.
If you have three, you can take the majority.
You don't really want to average them because if one of them
says 8:55 and the other two say 8:35,
you know which one's right.
