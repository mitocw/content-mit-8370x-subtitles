The idea is based on photons.
So the idea is if you have a photon, it's a qubit.
It's either-- you can measure it in this basis, this basis,
and you can measure it in this basis,
but you can't measure it in both places.
So these are conjugate bases.
And you're putting it in one of these two bases,
which means it's--
this is why Wiesner called his paper "Conjugate Coding."

And if you have photons in this basis,
and somebody tries to measure it in this basis,
they destroy them in this basis, which means
they're no longer what you did.
In other words, if you have a photon measure in,
the original state gets destroyed.

So that's the idea behind Bd84.

So I'm going to start with the simplest idea.

So let's say Alice chooses bases.

So let's say there's one for each photon.

And then she encodes--

let's say 0 is one of these, and 1 is either that.
No, 0 should be vertical and 1 should be horizontal, I think.

There we go.
So this is-- sends random bits.

And I should say she chooses her basis randomly.

So now let's make one of these that.
So now Bob chooses random basis and measures.

And whenever they agree, Bob gets the same thing.
Wherever they disagree, Bob gets a random bit.

OK.
Now, after Bob has measured, Alice sends Bob her basis.

Sends Bob bases.

Discard ones where they don't agree.

So let me mark the ones that agree.

Have randoms-- have bits--
well, so this is 0 1 1 0 1.
No, wait.
0 1 0 0 1 0 1.
0 0 1 0 1.
And now, assuming everything went perfectly,
they have the same random bits, which
means they share a secret key, which means they can use this
as a secret key for some crypto-system
and communicate securely.
And if they want to be absolutely secure,
they can use a one-time pad to communicate
using these random bits.

So I should have put--

I should have said what assumptions I'm using,
but we'll do that later.
So if everything went perfectly--

went perfectly-- they share a secret key.

But suppose there was an eavesdropper.
Well, they wouldn't know that she'd know.
She might have gotten some bits of their secret key.

The idea is can check half the bits to see if they agree.

And if half of the bits agree, other half
probably agree and probably no eavesdropper.

But there's all these probablys in there.
We don't like those.
Good.
Bob sends basis to Alice.
But he only does that after he measures
because he wants to make sure that if an eavesdropper is
measuring, she doesn't know which basis
he's sending them in.
And if she measures in the wrong basis,
she's going to get some of the bits wrong.
So I want to add a line here.
So what they do is they check some of their bits,
find the error rate by comparing a sample of their bits--
a sample of their bits.
