So the next question is how do we
compute c if we have a whole bunch y's
that are perpendicular to c?

And for this, we actually need to use linear algebra over gf2.
There's one big difference between linear algebra
over finite fields and standard familiar algebra.

Difference between linear algebra
over reels over finite fields is you can have x, a vector--

let's say, 110101010.
And x dot x equals 0.

X dot x equals 1 plus 1 plus 1 plus 1 equals 4 mod 2 equals 0.
So that is the big difference.
