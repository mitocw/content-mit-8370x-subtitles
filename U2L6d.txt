So now I want to draw a picture.
So this is alpha, this is beta.
And alpha and beta are orthogonal,
because alpha does not include the basis state
beta in its sum.
And here is psi equals--
and what was it?
1 over root N beta plus remaining alpha.
Root N minus 1 over root N alpha plus 1 over root N beta.

And we're assuming N is large, so this is very close to alpha.
The inner product of alpha and this
is root N minus 1 over root N. And now we want to look at 2
psi psi minus I.
So what does this unitary transformation--
well, you can see it's unitary right here-- do?
It does nothing to psi.

So I don't know what to call this.
So we could just call it pi 2 psi psi minus I applied to psi
is just 2 times psi minus psi equals psi.
So I want it plain as it takes a state here
and it reflects it around the line psi.

So assuming it's a supervision of beta and alpha.

So we just have to worry about states
that look like alpha plus beta.
So x alpha plus y beta.
So I see that I did not prepare this
well enough, because I thought it was obvious
when I was preparing.
And there probably is an obvious explanation for it,
but I don't see it right now.
So 2 psi psi minus alpha minus I applied to alpha
is equal to 2 psi psi alpha minus alpha.

OK.
Well, 2 psi psi times alpha is going
to be some product of psi.

It's going to be some multiple of psi.
And alpha is going to stay the same.

And psi was what?
Psi was 1 over root--

so let's take this.
You get psi is equal to--

oh, yeah.
Psi equals root N minus 1 over root N alpha
plus 1 over root N beta.

So you take this inner product.
You get 2 root N minus 1 over root N alpha plus 2--

2 root N minus 1 over root N psi minus 2 alpha
equals 2 root N minus 1 over root N alpha minus--
I don't think this is the right way to do it.
Plus 1 over root N beta minus 2 alpha.

So we started with alpha.

So we started with alpha, and we ended up with 2 root N minus 1
over root N beta, which I think you can--

so we start with alpha.
We end up above this.
And it's a unitary transformation,
which means inner products are preserved.
So after the unitary transformation,
this angle has to be the same as that angle.

And we started out--
no, we clearly end up above this line,
and we start out below this line.
And inner products have to be preserved,
so this has to go to that.
And it also is unitary transformation, which
means it preserves the plane.
So if this point gets reflected up to here,
the entire plane has to be reflected around this line.

So this is what it does.
And so, this reflects a line--
reflects this alpha and beta plane around the line psi
equals root N minus 1 over root N alpha plus 1 over N beta.

So what does the other thing do?
The other thing is x goes to--
the oracle. x goes to minus delta beta x.
Well, what does that do?
It does nothing to alpha, and it reflects beta
around the line x equals 0, around, I guess,
the line alpha equals 0, which is, I guess, y equals 0.

So what this Grover algorithm-- what this Grover iteration does
is it first takes this point and reflects it down here.
And let's say this angle is theta/2.
And it then takes the point down here and reflects it not around
the y-axis but around the line psi,
which is just a little bit above the--
sorry, just a little bit above the x-axis.

So what happens when you take one reflection and then
another reflection in a slightly skewed line?
Does anybody know?
Yeah?
Looks like a rotation.
It's a rotation, and it's a rotation of angle theta.

And how can you see that?
Well, I mean, you can break this--

OK, I really should do it for something more general
than this thing.
So I mean, suppose we started here.
This going down would be--

let's call this angle gamma.
Going down, we would have to reflect it around here.
So the angle below here would be theta/2 plus gamma.

And then reflecting-- reflecting around this.
Well, this has an angle of theta plus gamma with respect
to this line.
So above here it would have to be gamma.
So we started at an angle of gamma,
and we ended up at an angle theta plus gamma.
So that means we take whatever a thing is and we rotate it
by an angle of theta.

OK.
Now, we're basically done all the hard work
for Grover's algorithm.

Let's see.
What do I want to erase?

This.

We have sine of beta/2 is equal to 1 over root N,
just because this is 1 over root N times beta plus root
N minus 1 over alpha.
Now, we're going to assume N is big.

That means theta/2 is approximately 1 over root N.
And we want to ask how many iterations
to get to pi/2, because we want to take as many iterations
as we need to get to something very close to this angle
beta, this vector beta.
And then when we measure it, with high probability,
we get the answer.

Well, it's pi/2 divided by--
well, each of these angles is 2 over root N. 2 over root N
is equal to pi over 4 times root N.
So after pi/4 times root N of these iterations,
we have a quantum state that's very close to beta.
And if we measure it, we'd probably get our marked state.
Yeah?
Could you explain again what the theta/2 means?
Theta/2 is this angle.

So we're alternately reflecting it
around the x-axis and this line psi.
And it's the angle between the x-axis and the line psi.
So what are we reflecting?
Are we reflecting the line psi?
We start with a quantum state, which is--
we have a quantum state, which is a sub alpha alpha plus a sub
beta beta.

So that is somewhere on the unit circle here.
And we start by reflecting it around the x-axis,
and that corresponds to this thing.

And so we go down here.
And then the next step, we flipped it around--

these things reflect around psi.

And that takes it and moves it up there.

So that's one Grover step.
And it changes the angle by theta.
And we want to ask, how many times do we
need to change the angle by theta to get to the state
theta, which has an angle pi/2?
And the answer is 2 divided by theta,
which is roughly pi/2 divided by 2 root N, which
is pi/4 times square root of N.
So that Grover's algorithm when there is one thing
we're looking for.
