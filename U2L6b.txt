And now I will tell you the algorithm.
So a Grover iteration consists of four steps.

So first, let's assume N is equal to 2 to little n.
So assume we have a list of things which is of length 2
to the n.
And we can make this assumption without loss of generality,
because if we have a list that's not a power of 2,
we can just add non-solutions on it
until it becomes a power of 2.
And so with Grover iteration--

wait a minute.

Yeah.
One, apply oracle O, which takes x to minus 1
to the Kronecker delta of x and beta.
x.

So it does nothing to x if x is not equal to beta,
and it applies a minus sign to x when x equals beta.
Two, apply, the Hadamard transform.
Three, apply x goes to minus minus 1 to the x delta of x, 0.
x.
So here, you apply a minus sign if your quantum state is not 0,
and do nothing if your quantum state is 0.

And four, apply H to the n again.

So what is Grover's algorithm?
Well, we start with n qubits, all
in a superposition of 0 and 1.

And then we do the Grover iteration,
which has four pieces to it.
And another Grover iteration, and a whole bunch more Grover
iterations.
And, in fact, I think there are pi over 4 squared of n of them.

Yeah.
And then measure.

And we should have a solution with high probability.
