Now, I want to look at this a different way.
You know, for the Deutsch-Jozsa problem, Alice had an oracle.
And I want to say that she can use Bob as an oracle.
Alice can use Bob and communication as oracle.

Alice prepares i 0.
She sends this to Bob.

Now, Bob applies c not from f of i 2.

OK.
Let's label these.
Let's label them b and n, or not n, r.
Or maybe r1 and r2.

So what Bob wants to do is he wants to do--

well, Bob does not want to measure i.
But he wants to have a quantum circuit which
takes his value of i, looks up the value of the function,
and then applies it to this qubit.
And he wants to do this all coherently.
So if Alice sends him a bunch of things in superposition,
Bob does thise all.
Bob's things stays in superposition.
And you can write down a circuit to do this.

I think we gave you a homework problem for writing down
a circuit that did it in one of the first few weeks.
But you know, you can do this with the classical circuit.
So you can do it with a classical reversible circuit.
So you can do it coherently with a quantum circuit.
And then Bob sends us back to Alice.
So Alice has 1 of root 2 summation i summation f of i.
i equals 0 to n minus 1.

So by passing log n qubits or log n plus 1 qubits to Bob,
and Bob passing them back, so you've used two log n
communication altogether, Alice has essentially
queried the oracle for Bob's function.
And, of course, Bob's function I said was g.
So I should be calling this g.

So Alice can use Bob essentially as an oracle
