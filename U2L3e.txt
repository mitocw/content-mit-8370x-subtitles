What information does y give us about f?
Well, how do we figure this out?
Well, what we want to do is we want
to figure out, what is the probability of seeing a given y
f of x.

Seeing y f of x.

Well, let's think about this.

What happens when we measure this?
We have a whole bunch of different terms in this sum.
And what we do to figure out the probability
is, we group the terms which give you the same y f of x,
look at the coefficient on them, and then square it.

I mean, this is the way quantum mechanics works.
You expand this thing in, say, a basis,
and then the probability of seeing a given basis element
is a coefficient on it squared.
So what's the probability of seeing y f of x?

Well, f of x can come from two, can come from two different
X's.
Call them X and X plus C.
And it doesn't really matter which one
you call X, the result of the computation will be the same.
So we get y f of x from X and X plus C.
Would it be less confusing if I labeled this X X0?

I think it might be.

So some f comes from two different X's,
which we'll call X0 and X1, which equals X0 plus C.
So the probability of seeing Y f of x
is, well, there's a 1 over 2 to the N on the front.

And there's a minus 1 to the X0.Y. And there's a minus 1
to the X1.Y. And then we want to square the whole thing.

Well, this is equal to, well, X1 is X0 plus C.
So this is 1 over 2 to the n minus 1 to the X0.Y minus 1
to the X0.Y plus C.Y, whole thing squared.

And now we can factor out this X0.Y
because, we know it's in this term, and it's in this term.
And when you factor out, well, either plus 1 or minus 1,
and you square it, it turns into 1,
so this is just 1 over 4 to the n,
1 plus minus 1 the C.Y squared is equal to, I guess,
4 to the minus n plus 1 if--

well, if C.Y is 1--

we're doing everything in [? mod ?] 2.
So C.Y is either 0 or 1.
If C.Y 1, this is 1 minus 1 squared is 0.
And if C.Y is 0, this is 1 plus 1 squared, which is 2.
So it's 4 to the minus n.1, and plus 1 if Y.C equals 0,
and 0 if Y.C equals 1.
So we only find Y's that are perpendicular to C.
So that gives you one bit of information about C.
And we need n bits of information about C.
So we need to repeat this order of n times.
And that will tell us of enough information
