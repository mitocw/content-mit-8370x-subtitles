Let's work through something concrete.
First I would like to show you the example of a particle
in a one-dimensional well.
This is entry-level quantum mechanics,
and I start at this point because you're
very familiar with it and it will
let me illustrate the first two steps in a quantum simulation
process.
Imagine that you have a particle located
on a one-dimensional axis, and there's some potential v of x.
Particle is somewhere delocalized in here.
Let the scale of this be from minus d to plus d or so.
And the particle is governed by a Hamiltonian
which is of the form p squared over 2m plus v of x.
So this is the energy of a free particle, the kinetic energy.
This is potential energy.

And, in analogy to what you saw over there with molecules,
this is the set of T terms, and this is the set of V terms
that are canonical in a molecule, as well.
So, this is a very simplistic scenario,
but it's not all that far away from the more complicated
molecular Hamiltonian.
And the first step that one employs
in simulating the dynamics of this physical system
is discretize.

So normally we'll have some continuous set overlaying
infinite one-dimensional axis.

So, you can imagine that these are some coefficients
that you have.

I have this complex conjugated.

OK.
dx.

So this is now expanded into eigenbases of position x.
And the natural thing for us to do
is to replace this with something discrete, like k
delta x, so that this is in some way now going
to be a sum over some coefficients c sub k of k delta
x, where we choose the delta x to be sufficiently small
and defined over this discrete interval from minus d to d.
OK?
So many of you have done this, especially
if you're doing a computer simulation of such
a particle in a potential.
Should be very comfortable.
The second thing that you do is to be
able to simulate the Hamiltonian.
So you evolve a system.
Now, how does one evolve a system under a Hamiltonian?
The problem is that this Hamiltonian here
is comprised of two parts, H1 and H2, and they don't commute.

So I cannot just let my evolution eat the minus iHt.
I've dropped all my H bars today.
I cannot simply let this be e to the minus i H1t e to the minus
iH2t.
I cannot evolve with one Hamiltonian,
then evolve with a second Hamiltonian,
even though they're added here, because they do not commute
with each other.
And this should be something you're very familiar with.
