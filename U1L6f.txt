So the quantum strategy.
And Bob, share 1/2, 00 plus 1, 1, 0, 0, plus 1, 1.

And then each of Alice and Bob make measurement--
[INAUDIBLE] I don't want to say a measurement.
I want to say an observable.
Yeah.
So they measure-- let's say they measure some observable.

On, depending on a and b, which are the random numbers that
[? were ?] set that tell which column or row they want.

OK, and now I'm going to write down a matrix,
and then I'm going to explain how that gives you
the observable, and then we'll be done.
