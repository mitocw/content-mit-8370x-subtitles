Why does this take much more communication
when it's done classically?
Actually, if Bob just took Logan random bits
and set them to Alice and said which of these bits
they were of his function, Alice could
decide very high probability whether the function was
constant or balanced because with high probability
either of these log in random sample
bits is going to be either half and half, 0, and 1,
or all zeros or all ones.
When she XRs Bob's bits with her bits.
But if you want it deterministically,
you can show that Bob needs to send Alice essentially
all of his bits.
Yeah?
So this is basically no different
than the normal Deutsch QS algorithm in terms of speed up.
Right.
This is exactly the same as a normal Deutsch's algorithm
in terms of things speed up.
And in fact, all of the things we do today
are going to be the same as the classical counterparts in terms
of speed up.
They're nondistributed counterparts?
What?
They're nondistributed counterparts?
They're nondistributed counterparts.
Right.
So yeah, and I'm not going to explain
how you prove that Alice and Bob can't
do this deterministically, but it's not too hard for.
