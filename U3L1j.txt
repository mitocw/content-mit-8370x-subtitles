So how do you correct errors?
Well, what we're going to do is we're
going to define H as equal to--
well, what we're going to do is we're
going to take this parity check piece of the matrix
and stick it up here.

And now we have that GH equals 0.

Why?
Well, in general, let's say G equals is.

H equals minus si, so s equals minus s, if they're binary.
GH is equal to--
well, just multiply.
i minus s plus s times i minus s plus s equals 0.

So GH equals 0.

So G is a four dimensional subspace
of a seven dimensional thing.
H is a three dimensional subspace,
or the column space of H is a three dimensional subspace
of a seven dimensional space.
And H is actually the perpendicular subspace to G.
And you will notice that H and G have a lot
of the same vectors in them.
Or maybe you won't notice that, because it's not
completely clear given this, but every vector in H,
every row here is also a vector in G.
And that's because, well, if you take 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0
and take the inner product of itself, you get 4, which is 0.
So even weight vectors are perpendicular to themselves.
So a vector can be perpendicular to itself.
And that's going to be very important later when
we get to quantum Hamming code.
