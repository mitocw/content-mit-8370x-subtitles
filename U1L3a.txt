The quantum mechanics in this course
is going to be essentially linear algebra,
and there are a few things I expect
you know from linear algebra.
And I think most people will actually
know these even if you haven't had a linear algebra course.
So I expect you to know what a vector is, what a matrix is,
how to add and multiply them, and what an eigenvalue
and eigenvector are.

So there will be a lot of linear algebra in this course that
probably isn't taught in 18.06.
And I will try to--
I will explain that to you.
So what you don't need to know are
I guess unitary matrices, Hermitian matrices,
and tensor products.

So these will be explained in the next few lectures
along with their uses in quantum mechanics.
And nearly all the quantum mechanics
we're doing in this course will be finite dimensional quantum
mechanics, which means it deals with finite dimensional
matrices and vectors, and their naught operators, and all
the stuff that you need to worry about when you get
to infinite dimensional spaces.

So hopefully everybody knows this stuff,
