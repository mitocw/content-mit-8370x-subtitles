In this class, we're going to be talking
about a lot of different quantum gates.
And so last class, I told you about see
CNOT gates, and Toffoli gates, and maybe Fredkin gates, and N
gates, OR gates, et cetera.
So we're doing quantum computation
in the circuit model, which means
we'll be stringing together bunches of quantum gates.
And we need a name for all these quantum gates
or not all of them.
Sigma x is 0 1 1 0.
Sigma y is equal to minus i i 0 0.
Sigma z is equal to 1 0 0 minus 1.

H is equal to 1 of root 2 1 1 1 minus 1.

And there's two more.

S is equal to 1 0 0 i.
So S squared equals Z. And T is equal to 1 0 0 e to the 2 pi
over 4.
So T squared equals S.
And Seth Lloyd has a great technique, a great mnemonic
for remembering which of these is the minus i and which
of these is the i.
And his mnemonic is minus is lighter than i,
so it floats to the top--

floats to the top.
So if you can remember--
so if you can remember it's either minus i i or i minus i.
This tells you which of the two is the minus.
And that's the only really hard thing to remember about this.

So what happens when we apply two of these Pauli matrices?
What happens when we multiply two of these Pauli matrices?
Well, let's do it on the Bloch sphere and then--
so sigma x keeps the x-axis the same
and interchanges the minus y-axis and minus z-axis
to get units.
Sigma y keeps the y-axis unchanged
and then changes the z-axis and the x-axis units.
So you multiply sigma x and sigma y.
Well, you flip the minus x and x vectors.
You flip the minus y and y vectors.
And you flip the minus z and z vectors,
but then you flip them back.
So sigma x times sigma y is sigma z,
except that's not quite right, because we're not--
we're leaving out signs.
So sigma x sigma y is equal to--
actually, I think, i sigma z.
Let's check that.
Sigma x times sigma y, the top-left corner is an i,
and the bottom-right corner is a minus i.
So we get i minus i, which is, indeed, i sigma z.
And sigma y sigma z is equal to minus i sigma x--
plus i sigma x.
Sigma z sigma x equals i sigma y.
So you multiply two Pauli vectors.
You get an i times a third one, assuming you multiply them--
no, x times y or sigma y times sigma z or sigma
z times sigma x.
And then sigma y sigma x equals minus i sigma z.

So an important thing is the three Pauli vectors.

Well, they anti-commute pairs.

Sigma x sigma z equals minus sigma z sigma x.
