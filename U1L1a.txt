OK, so there are four units of this class.
The first unit is fundamentals.

So most of you will have at least some of this stuff.
So circuits, reversible circuits, circuits,
quantum states.

OK for the math majors, these are just vectors.

Quantum, I guess, what did we call it?

Quantum evolution.

These are just matrices, and measurement,
and tensor products, and then quantum weirdness.
So quantum mechanics is weird.
And I will talk more about that later in this lecture.
And we'll actually get to it much more when we get to it.
But we will discuss that.

And Unit 2 is quantum protocols and algorithms.

And what we're going to be doing is teleportation, factoring,
grover search.

And those are more or less the highlights of this unit.

Unit 3 is noise and codes.
So really what this is about is quantum error correcting
codes and their applications.

And the first part, fundamentals,
were actually not going to tell you much about quantum noise.
So we're going to go back to the fundamentals
and add quantum noise when we get here,
because you don't really need it until we get to this point.

And the fourth is models of quantum computation.
Quantum computation, which measurement,
distributed quantum algorithms, and the quantum adiabatic
algorithm.

So any questions about this stuff?
And as I said before, or as Ike and I said before,
there are going to be two precepts for each unit.
And then there's going to be a task after the first two units
