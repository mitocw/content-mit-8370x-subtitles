What is the algorithm and detail?
So suppose we have a bound on r.

Maybe I should call it r max, and choose
a power of 2 bigger than r max.
Or actually, choose a power 2 bigger
than 2 r max, and well, I will write down the algorithm.
We start with plus two the 2L zero.

That's here.
Next, we take the compute F of x, and whatever
ends in the first register, we compute
that in the second register.
But this is just some i equals 0 2 to the 2L i,
where i is just the binary representation of the number.
And we need to divide by 2 to the L,
because we want this to be a unit vector.

So we compute F. So this becomes sum to the 2L, i, F of i, i
equals 0 to 2 to the 2L to the quantum fourier transform.
So that's 1 over 2 to the 2L summation.

i is a really bad letter to use, because it's also
the square root of minus 1.
So let's use x.

OK, so the quantum fourier transform
takes x to let's call it z, F of x z
equals 0, 2 to the 2L minus 1.

e to the 2 pi i xz over 2 to the 2L.

So we've taken x and taken the fourier transform
of it, and that gives us this.

Now, what happens if we measure F of x?

Well, we're going to get some value for F of x.
And I'm going to leave out the normalization constant
for the time being, because the normalization constant just
makes figuring out exactly what's going on
with a normalization constant-- it's possible,
but it's a lot of tedious algebra,
and I'll come back to it later.
So we're out of normalized. z equals 0 through 2 to the 2L.

So let's call-- let x0 be the smallest x, x giving F of x.

So this is going to be z of the form x0 plus y times r,
because when we measure F of x, we only get--

not z When we measure F of x, we only
get x equals x naught plus yr, F of x 0, z
e the 2 minus 2 pi i x.

Well, xz, but x is in the form x0 plus yr, z over 2 to the 2L.
So what did we do?
We measured F of x here, and we're just
looking at the ones which give us F of x0,
and we know all of these x's are the form x0 plus yr.
And the phase factor doesn't change, and z doesn't change.
So now, we have the sum, and we have
to figure out how big it is.

Well, we can write sum z equals 0 through 2 to the 2L,
sum y equals 0 through 2 to the 2L over r, plus or minus 1
here, but that doesn't matter.
F of x0, z, e to the 2 pi i, x naught plus yr,
z over 2 to the 2L.
And what is this?
This is a geometric sum.
