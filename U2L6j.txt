So how do you use this for factoring?
So unitary x goes to g x mod N. So we're just
multiplying by some g.

So what are the eigenvalues of this?
And suppose g to the r turns to 1 mod N. So g has order r.
Eigenvalue or our eigenvector is some g
to the k e to the 2 pi i k l over r.

Because what happens if you multiply this by g?

Or rather, what happens when you apply the unitary?
U times 1 over root r g to the k e to the 2 pi i k
l over r is equal to 1 over root r, we have a sum here.
Sum g to the k plus 1, e to the 2 pi l over r is equal to--

well, so what we've done is we replaced g to the k
by g to the k plus 1.
But we can get from g to the k plus 1 to g to the k
by just rewriting the coefficients of the sum--
rewriting the index of the sum, k equals 0 to r minus 1,
making k prime to the pi i k over l.
So I want to say you can take k prime equals k minus 1,
and you get less than or equal to e to the minus 2
pi i l over r c.

So if you can estimate e to the minus 2 pi I over r,
you're done.

And we can do that with [INAUDIBLE] estimation.
OK, eigen.
So, the question is, should I go into this step in more detail?
Anyone?

Yes, OK.

So [? claing ?] summation g to the k, e to the 2 pi i k
l over r is an eigenvector--

let's call c sub l is an eigenvector.

And the proof?
Well, I want to divide this by 1 over root r.
Proof is we apply u with c sub l.

And we get 1 over root r sum go to the k [INAUDIBLE]
2 pi i k l over g to the k plus 1.

Because when we apply u to something, we multiply by g.
So taking g to the k, and multiplying it by g,
you get g to the k plus 1.
And now, let's let k prime equals k minus 1.
This is equal to 1 over root r sum.

Well, I want to say it's the same sum as before, because k
equals 0 to r minus 1.
We now get k prime equals 0 2 r--
k prime equals minus 1 2 r minus 2, but g to the k plus 1--

I mean, but g to the 0 is equal to g to the r,
so we can use the same limits on the summation--
go to the k.
We replace k plus 1 by k, e to the 2 pi i k
prime minus 1 l over r.
So this is the same as this, except we've multiplied
by e to the 2 pi i l over r.
Equals e to the minus 2 pi i l over r times our eigenvector.

So these are the eigenvectors of the [INAUDIBLE]
x goes to g x mod N.
Now there is one last step, which is--
I assumed that we had a unitarian eigenvector.
We don't actually have the eigenvector.
If we had the eigenvector, we would know how to factor.
But suppose what we could do is we
could pick a random eigenvector, and then apply this.
That would work.
So how do we pick a random eigenvector?
Well, that involves density matrices,
which I am going to talk to you about the first class
after the exam.
So the first class after the exam,
I will show you how you can--
well, maybe not actually pick a random eigenvector.
You produce something entirely equivalent to picking
a random eigenvector, and then that
will give you Kitaev's algorithm for factoring
by base estimation.

Right, so and then the last thing I should have said
is, once you know r, you do exactly the same thing--
continued fractions as you saw last time.
