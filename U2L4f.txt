The next part is only going to make sense
to people who understand the Cooley-Tukey FFT.
Recall, the Cooley-Tukey FFT had,
I guess, x0, x1, through x n over 2 minus 1 x n x n plus 1
through x n minus 1.
And you took this guy x1 with an x and a plus
root two plus x n plus 1, and you added these
and you subtracted these.
So you take this plus this over here
and this minus this over here.
That is a [? hedamark ?] gate.
And you need to add a factor of 1 over root 2
because, well, basically the Cooley-Tukey,
the discrete Fourier transform, you
have a 1/n on the inverse Fourier transform and a 1
on the forward Fourier transform.
But you need to balance those out so
that everything is unitary, and that
means each Fourier transform you need to divide by root 2.
And then you did funny things over here
that you multiplied all of these by what
I think the engineering committee calls
a twiddle factor.
And what's a twiddle factor?
Well, the twiddle factor is all of these r-gates.
And you're only multiplying if both [? cubits ?] are 1,
and that's just corresponding to this thing
because this is when both [? cubits ?] are 1,
essentially.

So that's a very hand-wavy explanation
of how that corresponds in the Cooley-Tukey FFT.
And if you don't understand the Cooley-Tukey FFT,
you don't really need to know that.
OK.
