Two level gate defined as cos theta, e to the i pi
sine theta, e to the i pi sine theta.
Or e to the i pi, e to the i pi sine theta.

I want this to be minus cos theta.

So I want these two columns to be orthogonal,
which I think means I need a minus e
to the minus i pi sine theta.

Because cosine theta times e to the i pi sine
theta with a minus sign, plus e to i pi sine
theta times cosine theta, and one's along the diagonal.

So this is what is defined as a two level gate in the Nielsen
and Chuang book.

And let's say, I suppose we could get--

so what I want to say is, suppose
we could get that this gate cos theta e to the i phi sine theta
minus e to e to the minus i phi sine theta cos theta.

So this is controlled, controlled U,
where U is this little matrix.
So you apply a U to the last qubit,
if all of the first K minus 1 qubits are 1
and, otherwise, you do nothing.

Well, then I want to claim we can get a two-level gate--

any two level gate.

Why?
Well, this is just a permutation of the rows and columns
of this.
And we can ply u sub pi.

So call this a c to the k u.

So this is some permutation U pi dagger
is equal our two level gate.

In other words, if--
so this is row 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1.
To get from here to here, where this
is row AB, what we need to do is,
we need a permutation that takes this guy to A,
and this guy to B.
But we can do that because we have Toffoli gates,
and they can produce any permutation we want.
So if we have Toffoli gates, and this multiply-controlled U,
then we can produce this.
Let's let U equal cos theta minus sign theta sine theta cos
theta.
U to the 1/2 is equal to cos theta minus sine theta,
sine theta cos cos.

XU to the 1/2 X is equal to--

I'm sorry, theta over 2, cos theta over 2,
sine theta over 2, minus sine theta over 2, cose theta over 2
is equal to U to the minus 1/2.

I'm now going to write down a circuit which is going
to produce U. At least, I hope it's going to produce U.
So this is a multiply-controlled not--
or a multiply-controlled X.
So what happens if one of these qubits is 0?

One of the first qubits is, get?

Well, that means these controlled nots do nothing.
So we get U inverse U, which equals identity.

If all control qubits are 1, 1, get--
well, what do we get?
We get XU to the minus 1/2 XU to the 1/2.
XU to the minus 1/2, XU to the 1/2 equals U.
So if we can do a multiple controlled qubit, or a multiply
control not, which we can, if we have Toffoli gates,
and we can do a U to the minus 1/2 and a U to the 1/2,
which we can if we have all 2 qubit gates,
then we can get U, where U is any real rotation.

And I haven't explained how to do complex rotations here.
I mean, I haven't explained how to get these, e to the i phi,
e to the bits here.
But I don't want to because it's along these same lines,
but more complicated.

OK.

Everything good so far?

Ah, but I haven't explained what we do with these two level
gates yet.

I'm not going to explain it in detail.
I'll just give a very quick sketch.
Suppose we want an arbitrary U. Well, that has values in all--

what do we do?
Well, let's apply a alpha, beta, gamma, delta.

Actually, maybe it's better if I used cos theta,
e to the i phi sine theta, minus e to the minus i
phi sine theta, cos theta, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1.
What you can do is, you can make this entry 0.
And then we can, by properly choosing these things.
And then we can multiply--

actually, I need to i phi sine theta--

e to the i phi sine theta, cos theta, cos theta.
So what I want to do is I want to change basis
by multiplying the two level matrix here by this guy,
by another, the inverse [INAUDIBLE] level.
So this is T. This is T dagger equals T inverse,
or T adjoint equals T inverse.
And this is the matrix we want to create.
You can set one of these entries to zero.
And now you can keep on doing this
until you get to this top entry, which then has to be unit
because we know all the columns in a unitary matrix are 1,
and we can keep on setting entries by 2, 0
by multiplying by given two level matrix
until we get a diagonal matrix.
And then, of course, to construct this matrix,
we put all of these, we move all of these two level matrices
to the other side and, to start with this,
multiply on each side by these T's and T
daggers until we get this.
So we can build any arbitrary matrix out
of two level matrices.

And we can build any two level matrices out of you know--
one out of one qubit matrices, and controlled--

or we can build any two level matrix out
of Toffoli matrices and multiply-controlled gates.
And we could build any multiply-controlled gate out
of Toffoli gates and one qubit gates.

So that explains everything except how
to get Toffoli gates.
