But suppose there's lots of things we're looking for.
What do we do?
We do exactly the same thing, except this oracle
multiplies phase by minus 1 if x is a solution.

OK.

And now alpha equals 1 over root n minus m.
x not a solution.

And beta equals 1 over square root of m
summation x for x a solution.

And if you look at this algorithm, it does exactly--
I mean, we have psi.
No, that's exactly the same algorithm.

We have reflection around psi and a reflection around alpha.
But psi in this case now becomes root n
minus m over root m alpha plus, I guess,
root m over root m beta.

sin theta 2 is root m over root n.
And theta over 2 is approximately--
so again, we're assuming that the number of solutions
is small compared with n.
If the number of solutions is large compared with n,
you don't need a quantum algorithm at all.
You just pick a random point and it's probably a solution.
So you can make Grover's algorithm work in those cases,
but there's really no need to.
And how many iterations to get to pi over 2?
Well, again, it's pi over 2 divided by theta
is equal to pi over 2 times--
well, theta was 2 root m over root m inverse.
So this is pi over 4 times root n over m.

OK, so this tells you how to find a solution if you know
