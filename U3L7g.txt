And that is another quantum key distribution protocol,
which is actually--
well, much harder to implement than the BB84 protocol
because all the BBT84 protocol uses
is photons that are one of four bases,
and Bob just measures them.
And a random basis-- that's incredibly easy to do-- well,
maybe not incredibly easy.
It's moderately easy to do with all sorts of different--
with standard equipment.
And in fact, John Smolan and Charles Bennett in--
oh, gosh, 1989 or so--
it's here, somewhere.
Anyway.
They built a apparatus that did this.
that was 30 centimeters long, and set qubits
in one of two states, and then decoded that--
measured them, decoded them.
And so this was secret communication
over a foot and a half.
And they-- actually, it wasn't really secret because
the apparatus made a different sound if it encoded a 0
or if it encoded a 1.
So it was secret for anybody who was deaf.
[LAUGHS]
But Jill Brossard remarks that after Charlie and John built
this test apparatus, physicists suddenly started paying
attention to quantum key distribution,
whereas before they haven't.
And Jill Brossard was rather amazed
by this belief in experimenting, which
I don't know whether physicists should be amazed by it, but--
