So we have j goes to one over root n e to the minus 2
pi i j k over n.
k, and let's sum this from k is 0 to n minus 1.
So that's the Fourier transform.
And now we're going to let these numbers be powers of 2,
or let n be a power of 2.
So j is equal to b sub n minus 1 b n minus 2 b0.

So that is-- so you can write out j in terms of its bits.
So this is a binary representation of j.
And k will be equal to b n minus 1, b n minus 2
through b0, except I really better not use
the same variables, because then I'll confuse everyone.
So I'll put a prime on k.
So now what happens?
Well I went to write this thing in terms
of the b's and the b primes.
So b n minus 1, b n minus 2 through b0
go through summation.

Let's just call it j.
Let's call it k equals 0 to n minus 1.
e to the minus 2 pi i, b n minus 1, 2 to the n minus 1,
plus b n minus 2 to the n minus 2 plus dot dot dot, plus b0,
times b prime n minus 1 to the n minus 1
plus b prime 0, all divided by 2 to the n times--
let's call this k.
So hopefully this-- so I'm multiplying this by this,
dividing by 2 to the n and getting k.

And now, here is where part of the magic comes in.
So we have b0 through b minus 1, b0 prime
through b n minus 1 prime.
We can multiply this whole thing out.
But it turns out that only half of these terms actually matter.
So can anyone tell me why?
[INAUDIBLE]
What?
[INAUDIBLE]
Roots of unity?
Well, yeah, but-- b to the 2 pi i, b j, b k, so our b prime k,
that would be 2 to the j plus k over 2 to the n.
So we get this.
Now, when is this equal to 1?

So let's assume b j and b prime sub k are both 1.
When is equal to 1?

Anyone?

OK, what is e to the 16 minus 2 pi i times 16?
Can anyone tell me what this equals?
0.
1.
1, because e raised to a multiple of 2 pi i
is 1, because e to the 2 pi i is 1.
So any power of it is 1.
So if this it 1, f of j plus k is bigger than or equal to n.

So this is the crucial thing to remember.
