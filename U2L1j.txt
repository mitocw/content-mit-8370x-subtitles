The last part of this lecture, I want
to explain to you why all of these parameters are optimal.
So let's see, message, transmission, entanglement.

So the message for teleportation it is 1 qubit.

And you turn it into 2 possible bits, which maybe I
should call civets.
And you need 1 EPR pair.

And for superdense coding, the message is 2 c bits.
You need 1 qubit and 1 EPR pair.

So can you do better?
What would happen?

Well, what would go wrong if you could encode 5 qubits--
no, 5 c bits, 5 classical bits by 2 qubits?

Well-- I mean-- so here think about this.
You can take 1 qubit to 2 classical bits,
and then you can re-encode them, 2 classical bits with 1 qubit.

So if you first apply superdense coding and then teleportation,
you actually haven't done anything.
You're sending 2 classical bits using 2 classical bits.
But what would happen if you could do better?

Well, what would happen is Alice could first take her 5
classical bits and then using some number of EPR pairs,
she could [INAUDIBLE] them into--

oh, let's-- here we go--

2 qubits-- no, ERR pairs, sorry 5 c bits--
so 2 qubits, 5 c bits, there.

But look, she could then go ahead and take these 2 qubits
and apply teleportation, superdense--
no, teleportation to them.
And so 2 qubits--
so Alice turns her 5 classical bits into 2 qubits.
But instead of sending these 2 qubits to Bob,
she takes them and turns them into 4 classical bits, again,
using more EPR pairs.

I guess, in this case, this is just standard teleportation.
So it's 2 EPR pairs.
And now Bob gets these 4 classical bits.
He turns them back into 2 qubits.
And then he takes these 2 qubits and turns them back
into 5 classical bits.
So now you've seen--
you see that we've taken 5 classical bits
and set them using 4 classical bits.
And you think there has to be something wrong there.
And indeed there is.
If you could do this, you could communicate faster than light.

Actually, I think this is probably
enough to convince you that this is impossible,
because you could take n classical bits,
turn them into 4/5 classical bits,
and repeat this until you turn them into 4 classical bits
and then set them over the wire.
So you can code any number of classical bits
in 4 classical bits if you could do better than this ratio
1/2 for teleportation and 2 for superdense coding.
But actually, if you can send 5 classical bits
with 4 classical bits, you can communicate faster than light.

And now I want to--
let's say, suppose you could take 10 classical bits,
encode them in 2 classical bits and 4 classical bits.

OK, this-- I actually just realized this uses something
about quantum particles that we haven't really explained yet.
So I won't--
I'll just give you the basic idea.
So let's map the 0 to one specific range
of 10 bits and a 1 to another specific thing of 10 bits.
And each of these gets mapped into--

OK.

So send them using 4 bits.

So what happens is Bob just guesses the 4 bits.
There's only 16 possibilities.
And then he pretends using these 4 bits to decode--
you know, to decode Alice's code with all possible--
you know, for all possible values of these 4 bits.
Well, only one of them--
we know there are only two possible values
of Alice's code.
And if you take these 4 bits and try to decode it,
it's very unlikely that that will give you the wrong one
for any of these 16 values.
So that means you know which message [INAUDIBLE]..
OK, so in reality, it is much more complicated than that,
because you need to make sure that you can try all
of these things using the quantum operations
that you have to do on your end.
And that's-- and proving that requires some information about
quantum algorithms that we haven't gotten into.
OK, so where were we?
Well, we showed that this was optimal.
We showed that this is optimal.
Now I want to say that 1 EPR pair is optimal for teleporting
1 qubit.
So suppose 1 EPR pair--
suppose you could teleport 2 qubits with 1 EPR pair,
with 1 EPR pair.

Well, what could Alice do?
Alice could take 2 EPR pairs, encode--
well, teleport the first qubit in each to Bob--

qubit in each to Bob.
And now-- and she destroys 1 EPR pair doing this,
but now Alice and Bob have 2 EPR pairs.
So then Alice could take 4 EPR pairs.
And with her 2 EPR pairs, she could
teleport the first qubit in each of these 4 EPR pairs to Bob.
And then Alice has destroyed her 2 EPR pairs,
but now Allison and Bob have 4 EPR pairs.
So they can keep on doing this and generate as many EPR pairs
as they want, which again has to be a contradiction,
because you can not send quantum information
over a regular telephone line.
So that shows that this and this are all optimal.
So this is optimal too, but it requires Holevo's theorem.
It requires the fact that if you have 2 qubits,
you cannot encode more than 2 classical bits,
or rather if you have less than 1 EPR pair and 1 qubit
that's fewer than 2 qubits and it requires 2 qubits to encode
2 classical bits.
So if you could do better than this,
you would break Holevo's theorem,
which says 1 qubit can only encode 1 classical bit, which
we're not going to get to this term, but which if you take,
Ike's advanced quantum information class--
I forget what it's called--
he will cover it, OK.
