Let's go over the classical circuits.
And, well, NAND is universal.

Actually, this isn't quite true because NAND plus fanout
is universal, but fanout is usually taken
for free in classical circuits.

So when people are designing chips for CMOS,
what basic gates do they use?
Anybody?

Yeah?
NAND, NOR, and NOT
Yeah.
CMOS.
NAND, NOR, and NOT.
So any idea why?
It's easier to build that out of transistors than to put-- like,
that's what naturally comes out.
And you just have two transistors maybe.
And then to make an AND you'd have to invert that,
so it's just--
Yeah, well you can make a NOT, make an AND
by using a NAND followed by a NOT.
And that is, well--
so AND is more complicated to build than NAND.
So you might as well just stick with these three, I think.
But you don't want to use just NAND because then you
would have to work hard to get NOR and NOT.
And you don't want to work hard.
You want to choose a set of gates and the universal basis
that is as easy as possible.
So quantum circuits.

Universal gates.

OK.

So we're going to build a quantum circuit out
of some set of universal gates.
And the universal gates we choose, well,
all 2 qubit gates.

So I think this is what we're going
to prove is universal today.
CNOT, all 1 qubit gates, and CNOT, H X, Y, Z, T and S gates.

And people should remember what H, X, Y, and Z gates are.
So let me remind you what S is and what T is.

S equals 1, 0, 0, i.
And T is equal to 1, 0, 0.
e to the pi i over 4, and T squared equals S. So this
as a universal set of gates.
And of course, it's not the smallest universal of gates
because X can be H, X. Z is H, X, H, et cetera,
but this is the universal set of gates
used by Nielsen and Chuang, in the book,
and it's a reasonably good set of gates.
When you actually go to build a quantum computer,
you may not use this set of gates
because maybe there will be other gates which
are much easier to implement.
Because you have much more freedom choosing
which gates to use in a quantum computer than you
do in a classical computer.

So I want to give a proof that these are--

proof 2 qubit gates are universal.
And actually, I should put a caveat to this statement.
CNOT, H, X, Y, Z, T, S cannot produce all gates.

Can anyone give a reason why this is true?

[INAUDIBLE]
Produce all quantum gates.
Yeah, I think they can produce all quantum gates.

Quantum unitary gates.

But you can, because what you can do is,
you can with CNOTs and H, and these, you
can get a lot of different phase shifts.
Yes?
I was basically going to say the same thing.
OK.
[INAUDIBLE]
OK, how many circuits can you build out of these gates?
A countable number of circuits and uncomfortable number
of gates.

Because there are continuous variables in here,
which is an uncountable number, and there is a countable number
of circuits.
Does it mean anything to say that you can approximate
an uncountable number of gates with a countable number
of circuits?
Yeah, right.
But you can get arbitrarily close to any gate.

And in fact, you can get arbitrarily
close to an any gate with a circuit of reasonable size
of these, where you need to define what reasonable is,
but it's polynomial in the error you want.

And that's called the Solovay-Kitaev theorem.
It's not easy to prove.
And we're not going to prove this.

So this is actually good enough.
