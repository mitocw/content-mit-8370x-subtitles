There's a very practical application
of this, which, well, practical in an application
maybe is not practical for quantum computers.
But say I have free time day 1, 3, 17, 19, 30.
And you have free time, our my colleague
has free time, days 2, 6, 10, 19, 22, 23, 24.
And we want to arrange a meeting.

How many bits do we have to send back and forth
to figure out that we're both free on the 19th?

So this is the disjointedness problem.

And I will talk about it later today.
