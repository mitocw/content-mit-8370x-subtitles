OK, so what I want to do now is say something
about quantum mechanics.
We'll be covering that in more detail two lectures from now.
So quantum mechanics.

And quantum mechanics was really developed somewhere
between 19--
well, it took several decades to develop quantum mechanics,
and I'm putting down 1900 through 1930
although you could argue a lot about different dumb dates.
And Einstein, Podolski, and Rosen
in 1936 said that quantum mechanics--
they published a paper that was really saying quantum mechanics
is incomplete.

And the reason-- well, let's put this in quotes
because people don't believe this anymore.
The reason is you can take two particles,
and they can have opposite momenta and opposite
positions, x and minus x.

And these particles--
So you can prepare these particles
so that whenever you measure their momentum,
they're opposite.
This is minus p and p, and whenever
you measure both of their positions, this one is at x,
and this one is at minus x.
And you cannot measure the position and the momentum
of the same particle because quantum mechanics says that
this is impossible because the position and momentum are
conjugate variables.
And we will-- well, we're not going
to be using continuous variables,
but we will explain what happens with discrete variables
at some point later in just a few lectures.

So that means that, well, this particle
must have a momentum because if you measured this particle,
it will give you that momentum.
And this particle must also have a position
because if you measured this particle,
it would tell you about this position.
But quantum mechanics says this particle cannot have both,
so there must be some information this particle knows
that quantum mechanics doesn't tell you about.
So quantum mechanics is incomplete.

And what Schrodinger said--
Schrodinger replied to this by just saying, no,
it's not incomplete.
These particles are entangled, and that's just the property
that entangled particles have.

So maybe this wasn't really satisfactory for Einstein.

Or actually Schrodinger said they were [INAUDIBLE] shrinking
and not entangled.

What happened in 1964?
1964 Bell proved that no classical explanation
for the behavior of EPR appears.

EPR, I should say, because Einstein, Podolski, Rosen came
up with this pair of particles and EPR pair
is what they are called.

And their-- Bell proved that there's
no classical explanation for EPR pairs.
So if quantum mechanics is incomplete,
it's incomplete not in a classical way
but in a way that gets even weirder
than quantum mechanics, which I don't think
would have satisfied Einstein at all.

And in fact, these--

I don't have the date but 1980-something Aspect showed
Bell's predictions were correct, and people have been improving
Aspect's experiment--
I mean when Aspect showed Bell's predictions were correct,
a few very doubting people said, but what about this loophole?
What about this loophole?
There could still be a classic explanation.
And people have been closing these loopholes ever since,
and I think they're pretty much all closed now
with the latest experiments, which just
happened in the last few years.
So there's no classical explanation
for quantum mechanics.
So quantum mechanics is really weird.

And now I want to talk about what happened next.
So in 1982, Herbert in respectable physics journal
published a paper called "Flash--

First Laser-Amplified Superluminal Hookup,
which is really faster than light communication.

Communication using weird properties of EPR pairs.

Superluminal what?
Communication using weird properties of the--
H, hookup.
Hookup?
H is hookup.
Obviously designed for the acronym.
Using weird properties of mechanics and EPR pair.

Now, one of these referees of this paper was Asher Peres,
and Asher Peres said in this referee report, well,
this paper has to be wrong, but I can't
understand why it's wrong.
So why didn't you publish it, and we'll see someone come up
with the flaw in the paper.
So this paper is indeed wrong.

But in 1982, two groups of people looked at this
and figured out why the paper was wrong and published
the no-cloning theorem, which we will get to, which says that
a single quantum state--

actually technically, I should probably say a single unknown
quantum state cannot be duplicated.

So how much of this theorem is due to this Berkeley hippie who
came up with this wrong paper?
Well, it probably wouldn't have been discovered in 1982 if he
hadn't published this paper.
It probably would have been discovered eventually.

Now, I want to get to--

So in 1985, David--

Let's go back to 1982.
Feynman and simultaneously in the Soviet Union Manin,
but a year or two earlier, said very
difficult to simulate quantum mechanics requires 2
to the n, resources or time for n particles.

And then they said, quantum computers might be faster.

Well, they said would be faster.

So use quantum mechanics to simulate quantum mechanics.

Excuse me.
In saying 2 to the n time, you mean order of 2
to the n complexity?
Yes, order of 2 to the n--
I should really say cn because it's not--
well, depending on exactly what you mean, it's exponential.
But this is a very vague statement,
and depending on how you make the statement precise,
this tying down might be more or less.
So it requires 2 to the n complexity
to simulate n particles.

Computational steps is really complexity.
And we will say more about this--
we'll say more about what complexity is in next lecture.
So what happened after that?
Well, David Deutsch described the quantum Turing machine.

Said it would be good for simulating quantum mechanics
although he didn't go into any details.
And when you do go into the details,
it's much more complicated than it sounds at first.
And asked is it good for classical computing?

So this is the first--

Feynman and Manin-- if a quantum computer is better
at simulating quantum mechanics than a classical computer,
maybe--
why shouldn't it be better for classical problems
than a classical computer?
It's not clear that anybody before Deutsch
asked this question, and really in this paper,
he gave some very, very unsatisfactory answers.
But in 1982, to Deutsche and Jossa said, yes, sort of.
So much, much less than satisfactory answer.
And after that, people really started thinking
about quantum computing.
And Bernstein and Vazirani in 1993 and 1994,
Simon came up with a problem that
is exponentially faster on a quantum computer.

And roughly, this is where I came in
because I was on a conference program committee
where he submitted his paper.
And, unfortunately, we decided to reject it.
I have the satisfaction I argued for its acceptance,
but in retrospect, I clearly should
have been jumping up and down, demanding that it
be accepted instead of just--
instead of what I did, which was much less demonstrative
but yes.
And this uses periodicity So I had the idea, well,
periodicity might be important.
Discrete log and factoring, which are very important
classical problems used periodicity.
So maybe quantum computers can do factoring.
So in 1994-- actually Simon's paper was written in 1993
but not published in 1994.
I think I saw it in January of 1993--
factoring in discrete log.

On quantum computer 1994.
And this is really where the field of quantum computing
took off.
I mean before here--
before 1994, it was a bunch of people
that most physicists thought were kind of a little bit
crazy.
And indeed some of them really were crazy.

Looking at it in 1994, after the factoring result everybody
started thinking about it.
And then in 1996--
Can I ask a question about the 1990 assignment thing?
It's not clear that, for example, simulating quantum
mechanics is in that category or where quantum [INAUDIBLE]
Oh, no.
Similar quantum mechanics is--
so it's not-- simulating quantum mechanics is not
provably faster, but it's clearly faster.
But I was-- this is the question is quantum computing--
are quantum computer is good for classical computing
is this thread.

I think most people were agreed that quantum computers were
better for simulating quantum mechanics
than classical computers.

Although since then, people have discovered algorithms
that really work well for simulating some quantum
problems that people didn't know how to simulate before then so,
classical computers are getting at-- better
at simulating quantum mechanics, too.
So, in 1995 or so, Lov Grover came up
with his search algorithm, which searches a space of size, n,
and route n steps.

And after that-- well, that's as far
as we're going to do for algorithms in this class
because these are all very easily presented algorithms
that are very important.
And since then most quantum algorithms
are known for less important problems
