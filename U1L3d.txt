There's one more thing I need to say about quantum states, which
is multiplying a quantum state by a global phase does not
change the essential nature of a quantum state.

But it needs to be a global phase.

For example, let's say down is essentially
equivalent to 5 times down.
But up plus down, which is equal to right,
is not equal to up plus I down over root 2, which
we said was into the board.
