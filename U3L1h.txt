In general, if the minimum weight,
non-zero code word has weight d--

has weight d-- you can correct t equal d plus 1
over 2 errors, d minus 1 over 2 errors.

OK, I seem to have forgotten one crucial fact here,
which is that c1 minus c2 is a code word--
c1 minus c2-- code word.

And the Hamming weight of c1 minus c2
is a Hamming distance between c1 and c2,
because a Hamming weight is the number of non-zero entries,
and the Hamming distance is the number
of positions they differ.

So the Hamming weight of c1 minus 2
is equal to the Hamming distance between c1 and c2.
And c1 minus c2 is the code word, well,
because the code is linear.
