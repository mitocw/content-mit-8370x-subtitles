Before I go any further, I want to tell you
what the circuit does.
And the circuit H H H H. The tensor product of n Hadamard
matrices applied to x, where x is something in the, you know,
0 1 basis of these qubits.
So x is a bit string length n.

Is equal to-- well suppose this is 0 1 0 1 1.
Here we get 0 plus 1, 0 minus 1, 0 minus 1.
And I should really put a 1 over 2 to the n over 2
in front of all of these.

So 0 plus 1 is--

So what we get is this product.
And let's normalize it.

So suppose we got this answer.
Let's call it y.
What would be the coefficient on y?
Is equal to-- well, it's the sum of a bunch of these things.
But let's look at one of them in particular.
What would the coefficient on y be?
Well, you would get 0 for the first bit.
You would get minus 1 for the second bit.

Let's make this a 1.
You will get a 1 for the third bit.
And 0 minus 1 is the last one--
you will get a minus 1 for the fourth bit.
So this would be a plus.
And in fact, if you expand this out, you get a minus 1
exactly when x has a bit that is a 1 and y has a bit that is 1.

So let's put a 2 the n over 2 here.

So what I want to claim is that this is equal to 1 over 2
to the n over 2 sum minus 1 to the sum xi yi,
i equals 1 2n y, where xi is the ith bit of i,
and xi is the ith bit of x and yi is the yth bit of y.

And what is this thing?

It's the inner product, its x dot y.
So this is equal to 1 over 2 to the n
over 2 summation over all y n.

Bit strings of length n minus 1 to the x dot y y.

Good.
