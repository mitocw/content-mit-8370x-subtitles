So gates.

Recall we had a universal set of classical gates.

Classical gates.

And can anyone tell me what a universal set of possible gates
is?
NOT.
Another one?
AND.
And that's universal, actually.
But actually, this is not.
If you look at it closely, there's
another gate that's implicit, which is FANOUT.

You put in a zero, you get out two zeros.
You put in a one, you get out two ones.

OK.

Now, quantum circuits.

Well, maybe the equivalent of FANOUT in quantum circuits
is cloning.
So you can't use FANOUT in quantum circuits.
So NOT.

So there is actually--
so how do we do quantum circuits?

Well, gates for quantum circuits.

Well, the most important gate, maybe,
is CNOT, which is one, one, one, one.

Zero, zero, zero, one.
One, zero, one, one.

So what does this do?

Let's describe it.
If bit one is zero, OK, let's say this is x and y.
If x is zero, y goes to y.
If x is one, y goes to not y.

Right, because if x is zero, we're in this upper corner,
upper left corner.
AND is the identity.
If x is one, x being the first bit here,
we're in this lower right corner.
And this is a NOT.

And this is a classical reversal gate, as well as
a quantum gate, because--
well, basically because it's a permutation,
which means it's a classical--
you don't get any phases applied to any of the things,
and we don't get any superposition,
so it's a classical gate.

OK.

And quantum CNOT is drawn like that.

NOT, and in fact, if you have an arbitrary unitary, U,
you can draw it like this.
And a controlled U would be drawn like that.

And this, what does this mean?
It means apply i to qubit two if qubit one is zero.

Zero.
And if qubit one is one, apply U to qubit two.
And fU equals alpha, beta, gamma, delta.
Controlled U is equal to--
well, again, if qubit one is zero,
that's this upper left corner.
And if qubit one is one, that's this lower right corner.
And you can easily see that if this is unitary,
then this is unitary.

OK.
So the next thing I want to do is give some identities
on gates.

But first, maybe I should say something
about the controlled NOT gate.

So I'm going to say, CNOT can copy, well, not qubits,
but classical information.

So how does that work?
Well, so I want to say one, zero.

CNOT applied to zero, zero is equal to zero, zero.
CNOT applied to one, zero is equal to one, one.
Because this is a one, you take the NOT of this, you get one.
So CNOT of x zero where x is equal to zero or one
is equal to x, x.

So we can copy classical information.
And if we want to copy classical information in a quantum
circuit, we apply a CNOT.

And we cannot copy quantum information,
so that's as good as we can do.
Question?
For the controlled gates, can you
have other unitary, single-qubit gates
in the upper left instead of the identity?
You could, but then they wouldn't be controlled gates.
They'd be called something else.

So I mean, alpha, beta, gamma, delta.
Alpha prime, beta prime.

Why don't I--

U, U prime, zero, zero.
What this does is it applies U if bit one is zero,
and applies U prime if bit one is one.
But this is really not called a control gate, a controlled U
gate, although it's very similar.
