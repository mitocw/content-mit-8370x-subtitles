So Wiesner had a bunch of things in his conjugate coding paper.
One of these was a method to encode
two pieces of information with different bases
so that the receiver had a choice of decoding one of them
or decoding the other.
And of course, what you do is you encode one of them
while using error correction with the horizontal or vertical
basis, and the other with the diagonal basis.
And now, if you measure each of each
of these photons on a separate basis,
there is no way you can choose a set of bases
to learn both of these strings.
But of course, there's lots and lots of other measurements.
It turns out that there is a measurement, which
is a complicated entangled measurement you can make,
which tells you both of these bit strings
that we see the sender is trying to let
you have a choice of seeing one or the other.
So that piece of the paper actually
doesn't work with quantum mechanics.
And Wiesner bank notes paper really
does work with quantum mechanics although the disadvantage
of using this as quantum money is
to verify that this kind of money is really valid.
you have to call up the bank because it depends on--
so the idea was that the bank knows which basis each qubit
is encoded in.
But the merchant doesn't.
But then, if a whole bunch of merchants got together.
And each of them looked at his notes.
And they would call up the bank.
The bank would tell them which qubits
to measure in which basis.
If they got together and sneakily collaborated
they could actually learn enough information
to forge the bank note.
So this is not really a great way of doing quantum banknotes.
So I and some, Eddie Fahy and some former graduate students
at MIT have proposed a different way
of doing quantum banknotes which is actually
much more cryptographic.
And that we use knots and knot invariants.
And there is some task that depends on knot invariants that
we're assuming you cannot do with a classical computer,
[INAUDIBLE],, assuming you can't even do it without a quantum
computer.
So this is a possible scheme for quantum money
which nobody has broken yet.
But nobody is really that sure is secure
because nobody in classical cryptography
uses knot invariants.
So it's not at all clear that there's not
some sneaky classical algorithm that will break this quantum
