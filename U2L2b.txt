So the next question is, how are we given f?

And in this sense, we're really given f as an oracle.
Assume given f as an oracle.

So we're given a black box, and we input x,
and it outputs f of x.

Of course, this black box really isn't a quantum circuit,
because it has log n bits of input and one bit of output.

So a quantum oracle had better be reversible,
which means the number of inputs should
be the number of outputs.
So how do we do that?
Well, if you remember something Ike said in the second lecture,
he said that any quantum function
or any classical function could be made reversible as long
as you keep the input around.
So we'll assume this is true for this classical oracle.
We will keep the input around.
So you input x--
0, 1, 0, 0, 1.

And out comes the input.

And now, let's say this is sum [? beth ?] b.
What we're going to do is we're going to output b
exclusive or, XOR, f of x.

So this is definitely reversible.
Because well, first, it's its own inverse.
Because if you put another thing, you would get b, then b
plus f of x.
And when you add f of x twice, mod 2, you get b back.
