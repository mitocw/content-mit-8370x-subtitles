But first, I need to tell you something more
about quantum mechanics.
Two Hermitian matrices commute if and only
if they are simultaneously diagonalizable.

And actually, this is a much broader class of matrices--
this is true for a much broader class of matrices
than Hermitian matrices.
But since not all matrices are diagonalizable,
not all matrices are simultaneously diagonalizable.
So let's say-- let's call these matrices M sub A an M sub B.
They're simultaneously diagonalizable if--
so this is the definition--
if U A U dagger is a diagonal and U B U
dagger equals, call it, DA and DB for some unitary U.
So the first thing is, if they're simultaneously
diagonalizable, then they have to compute,
because DA and DB are diagonal matrices, so they commute.
And if DA equals DB, that implies that U A--
no, let's-- well, that implies that U--

I'm doing this wrong, aren't I?
What I meant to write down was DA equals DB.
So that says if U DA DB U dagger is equal to U DB DA dagger.
And this is equal to--

U dagger.
And this is equal to U B A U dagger.

I am moving too fast.
I'm not looking at my notes enough.
U dagger DA DB U equals U dagger DB DA U.
But because DA was U A U dagger, this is just equal to BA
and this is equal to--
well, let's write this one out--
equals U dagger U. DA was U A U dagger,
so this is U dagger U A U dagger U B U dagger
U, which is equal to AB.
So AB equals BA, if DA--
if the matrices are simultaneously diagonalizable.

Yeah, this is the one I should erase.
So now, suppose A and B commute.

Then U A U dagger is diagonal.

Well, Hermitian matrices are diagonalizable.
So there's some U such that U A U dagger is diagonal.
So U A U dagger is equal to lambda 1 I lambda 2
I lambda 3 I.
So let's look at what U B U dagger has to look like.

I want to claim that it has to look like B1--
or B-- yeah, B1, B2, B3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, et cetera.
So when you diagonalize A, you get the different eigenspaces
corresponding to the eigenvalues.
And when you apply the same thing to B,
you get B1, B2, B3, which are matrices, which
are just in these eigenspaces.
And now, you can diagonalize these three matrices,
because they're Hermitian.
And if you apply U prime I U prime dagger, you get I.
So when you diagonalize these matrices,
this matrix doesn't change.
So the only thing left to show is
why B keeps the eigenspaces of A intact.

B must keep eigenspaces of A intact.

So let's see what happens if we--
so let V--

I seem to have switched notation.
This should be A B. Let phi be eigenvector of A
with eigenvalue lambda.

Claim B psi is also an eigenvector of A
with eigenvalue of lambda.

And the proof is AB psi is equal to BA psi,
because A and B commute, is equal to lambda B
psi, because psi was an eigenvector of A
with eigenvalue lambda.
So we start with something in the eigenspace of A
with eigenvalue lambda.
You apply B to it.
You remain in the eigenspace of A with eigenvalue lambda.
And that says that all of these entries
are 0, which means that we can simultaneously
diagonalize A and B.
