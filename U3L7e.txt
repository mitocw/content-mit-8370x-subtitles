OK.
But it might still have learned a little bit.
So take hash lz to get your real secret key,
to get k, which maybe say l bits.
Cool And this process gets rid of Eve's information.

So this was Bennett and Broussard's protocol
they published.
And, of course, you don't know how
quantum mechanics and Eve's possible measurement
interact with this protocol.
So for a long time nobody could prove
that it was actually secure.
So I guess it was presented in 1984.
And there were two security proofs by 2000,
and they were both long and complicated.
And one of them, virtually nobody could understand.
And that's partially because it was not
written up very well, but also partially
because it was complicated.
So what I did was I looked at the one that
was incomprehensible and figured it out
and extracted the meat of it.
And then, with John Prescall, I published a much simpler proof
of security, which I will show you now.
