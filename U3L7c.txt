So now we did the assumptions.
Assume Alice and Bob have a classical channel.

Eve cannot-- can listen to it, but cannot change the bits
on it, which actually is called spoof in cryptanalysis lingo.
So Eve can listen on it, but she can't change anything on it.
And they have a quantum channel.
Quantum channel.

Eve can do anything.

In particular, she can cut the quantum channel,
which means they can't use quantum key distribution.
So what we have to do is we have to say that--

you know, not that Alice and Bob can agree on a bit,
but that Alice and Bob are very unlikely--
it's very unlikely that Eve can detect anything
that Alice and Bob agree on.

So those are assumptions.
Options So Bob sends Alice, chooses a basis randomly,
sends Bob, Bob sends a basis to Alice,
and Alice sends a basis to Bob afterwards.

Sends basis.

After all this stuff is done on the quantum channel,
and then they know which bits they agree on,
and if nothing goes wrong, they have a serial key.
But, of course, this is real life,
and real life channels are noisy.
Something you send as a vertical photon may get
measured as a horizontal photon.

And then, you know, they don't agree.
This would be 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1.
So-- and, of course, you can't tell
whether noise is Eve listening in or just the channel's noise.
So what do you do in real life to get rid of this thing?
Well, it turns out that the first bunch--
this protocol is exactly the same.
But then you do classical post-processing
on your random bits.

OK.
