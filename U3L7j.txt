Let's think about this.
Does Bob ever need s?
No because the random key that Bob and Alice agree on
is this co-set.
And, you know, so he's going to major this co-set
in the-- or major his qubits in the canonical basis.
And he doesn't care what basis they have.
So Alice doesn't actually need to send Bob s.

So if Alice doesn't need to send Bob s,
she can just send Bob the density matrix
you get when she chooses a random s.

Alice can average over s before sending it.
And it's just to seek care because if she averages over
s before she sends, it's indistinguishable from choosing
a random s and sending Bob the code word,
and not bothering to send Bob the s.
Good?
I mean this is--
remember, if you have an average--
if we averaged over s, all the diagonal elements went away
and all you got was--
well, this really corresponds to x plus c1, x plus c2,
1 x plus c2, x plus c3, and x plus c4.

Because that density matrix was here, so the different rows
where the different seeds that were in c1.
And if you average over s, it's the same
as just choosing a random x plus ci
instead of sending it to Bob.

So what is this?
Well, let's see what we got.
Alice chooses x in c.
And co-sets of c1 and c2.

Alice chooses random element of c1.

Alice chooses random shift.

Random shift T. Sends Bob--

we should call this something.

C. C of C1.
Sends Bob x plus C plus T.
Well, that's it.
And Bob measures.
Bob measures And Bob measures error rate.

Well, I mean, this is amazing.
We haven't-- we've changed the protocol around,
so now Alice isn't sending her anything other than qubits
in some state.
And Bob is measuring the qubits in some basis.
But this is completely--
this has gotten rid of any quantum computing whatsoever.

And in fact, this protocol is entirely equivalent to BB84.
