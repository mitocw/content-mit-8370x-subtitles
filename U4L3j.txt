So suppose you have two quantum computers.
Each has n qubits.

And we can send quantum messages between them.

I want to say, you can simulate a 2n-qubit computer.

How do you do this?

Assign the 2n qubits to each computer.

So you assign your 2n qubits in your 2n-qubit computer--
assign n of them to one computer and n of them to the other.
Any time you want to perform a gate between them,
between the qubits in the different computers, what you
can do is you can send the qubit from one computer to the other.

OK.
So that works pretty well, assuming
you can find some division of your 2n qubits
on your original computer so that there
wasn't that much computation occurring
across the dividing line.
So you don't have to send too many messages
between the computers.
So assume you can only send classical messages
between the computers.

Well, I want to say you're pretty much stuck.

Not simulate 2n-qubit computer.

Why not?
Yeah.
I was going to say, can't you just tell it
where it's going to be registered?
Well.
Yes, so if you have entanglement between the computers,
you're in good shape.

Suppose you have entanglement.

You can use teleportation.

So here I want to say, you cannot entangle the computers.

And in general, an algorithm on a 2n-qubit computer
will have a very highly entangled state in the middle.

And there are ways of formalizing this.
But I did not prepare them.
So I'm not going to go through them.
But if you want to have distributed
quantum computations and any reasonable sense,
you need to either teleport qubits
from one place to another or send quantum messages
from one place to another.
And the distributed quantum protocols we've been looking at
show that it's really useful to send quantum messages from one
to another.
Because here, at least in the classical, say,
Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm or the classical disjointness
algorithm where we're trying to find a date that we both have
free, we didn't assume anything about how
much computational power we were using.
We just showed that we couldn't do it
by sending classical messages.

So even if you had two quantum computers who--
each of them had your calendars in them
and you find a day that you both have free,
you need to send n classical messages between them
to find the intersecting day.
So that shows that quantum communication really
is more powerful than classical communication,
