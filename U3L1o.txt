OK, I want to say something about dual codes, given a code
c.
c dual is x such that x.c equals 0 for all c and c.

So a code is self-dual--

OK, I'm sorry, I've forgotten the exact definitions
of these things.
If c, I believe, is contained in c dual and for Hamming codes,
it turns out c equals--

let's see, did we have our Hamming code up here?

Yeah.
c is equal to 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1.
0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0.
0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1.
0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1.

Four dimensional.

And c dual is three dimensional because 7 minus 4 is 3,
and the dimension of the dual is always--
plus the dimension of c is always
equal to the total dimension, and generated by 1, 0, 0, 1, 1,
1.

So we need to find two more vectors that
are perpendicular to everything in here.

Let's say 0, 0, 1, 1, 0--

0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1 equals--

OK, so this is actually the second
plus the third vector here.
So that's 0, 1, 1, 0 times G equals 1, 1, 1, 1 times G.
And you can easily check this.
Wait, no.
1, 1, 1, 0, 1.
1, 1, 0 times G. Let's see, is this right?
Well, is this perpendicular to everything in here?
1, 1, 1, 0, 1.
Yeah.
Is this perpendicular to everything in here?

Yup.
Yup.

And this is also perpendicular to everything in there.

No, it's not because I copied this down wrong.
There we go.

There we are.
So this is a subset of our Hamming code.
And, in fact, the reason that a quantum Hamming code works
is because the dual of the Hamming code
is a subset of the Hamming code.
Yeah?
Should the definition of the dual
be the sets that x minus c is not equal to 0?
What do you mean x minus c?
The definition on the top board.
No, x dot c, inner product.
Good.
So it's all things which are perpendicular to every code
word in C. So you can check that these three things are
perpendicular to every code word in our Hamming code,
and you can check that these are also
a subset of our Hamming code.
And the reason, as I said, that the quantum Hamming code works
is because the dual is a subset of the Hamming code, which
is actually not very important for classical codes at all.
Yeah?
So does that say that it's equal to 0,
1, 1, G and also equal to 1, 1, 1, 0?
Oh, no.
The second row is equal to 0, 1, 1, 0 G and the third row
is equal to 1, 1, 1, 0 G. And this
is just equal to 1, 0, 0 G.
