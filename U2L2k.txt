There's a construction in the book
for how to build a Toffoli.

H, control NOT, TDagger, control NOT, T, control NOT, TDagger,
control NOT, TDagger, control NOT, TDagger, control NOT, T,
S. And I want another H after this.
Well, another T and then another H--
T, H.
So this constructs a Toffoli gate.

And it's not that hard to check.
So in the five minutes, I will do at least one case
for checking it.
Let's assume this qubit is a 0.

So to check it, all you have to do
is make sure that it gives the right answer
when any of the eight possible basis states is input.
So let's take care of four of them
by seeing what happens if this is a 0.
If this is a 0, well, this does nothing.
So this TDagger, T cancel each other out.
And now, we have to control NOTs on each other.
They cancel each other out too.
Now we have another T and a TDagger,
and they cancel each other out too.
And now we have an H and an H. And H squared is 1,
so those cancel each other out.
OK.

So now we have a TDagger, control NOT, TDagger,
control NOT, S. And if the first qubit--
So this TDagger does nothing, because it's
TDagger applied to 0 does 0, because T was 1, 0, 0, i.
So TDagger is equal to 1, 0, 0, minus i.
So now this turns it into a 1.
This TDagger applies a phase of minus i.
This turns it back to a 0.
This does nothing.
So if this was a 1, this TDagger and this T cancel out.
If the first qubit was a 0, then none of these do anything.
So if this qubit is a 0, then this circuit
does the right thing.
You can similarly see that the circuit does the right thing
if this is a 0.
And if these are both were 1's, what you get
is a TDagger followed by--

If first two qubits 1, get TDagger--

Well, no, you get x TDagger, x T, x TDagger, x T, T, n,
with an H on either S side--
H, H. TDagger is equal to 1, 0, 0, minus i.

T equals 1, 0, 0, i.
x TDagger x is equal to minus i, 0, 0, 1.

So this is minus i, 0 0, 1; 1, 0, 0, i; minus i, 0, 0, 1; 1,
0, 0, i-- which is equal to minus--

No, T isn't i.
It's square root of i.

I forgot.
Which is equal to--
I have two square roots of minus i's and two square roots
of i's, which is minus i, i--
which is equal to minus i times 1, minus 1.

So this whole thing is a Z. And there's a minus i on the front,
and you get H Z H, which is x.
So this is x times a phase if the first two qubits are 1.
And the phase is canceled out by this S.
Or, well, it's canceled out by all these guys.
So that is a sketch of why this thing is a Toffoli gate.

So this proves that two qubit gates are universal
for quantum computing.
OK, so are there any questions about anything.
Yeah?
So any arbitrary unitary measures
can be decomposed using [INAUDIBLE] using
only two-level gates?
Yes.
And when you do this, it always diagonalizes the identity?
There aren't any zeros on the deck?
No, you-- Well, it always diagonalizes to--
Well, when you diagonalize a unitary matrix,
you get either the i phi--
OK.
--either the i phi, something along the diagonal.
And then you have to fix those phases but you can
fix those phases with more--
So I lied.
So after you diagonalize it, you get e to the i phi 1,
e to the i phi 2, e to the i phi n.
And then you need to do something
to fix all these things.
But you can also do that with two qubit gates,
more two-qubit gates.
And in fact, I think you can actually
do that with two-level gates, but I can't be sure.

Any other questions?
Yes?
[INAUDIBLE]
Yeah, it does.
So why didn't you make the second half [INAUDIBLE]??
Well,
Well, so recall if the first two qubits are 1, this--

If the first two qubits are 1, so let's see--
What happens when we cut the circuit--
[INAUDIBLE]
Right.
So what happens then is you get the circuit 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1,
1, which is a Toffoli circuit.
Except actually, this is a minus i, minus
i, or something like that.
You get the right circuit, and it has a nasty phase
you don't want to [INAUDIBLE].
[INAUDIBLE]
Yeah.
So you want to remove the phase if both of these qubits are 1.
[INAUDIBLE]
No, because-- So what you want to do
is you want to apply 1, 1, 1, i on the first two qubits.
So if you multiply 1, 1 on the first two qubits by an i,
you cancel out this guy.

Why [INAUDIBLE]
Because these qubits are 0, 0, 0; 0, 0, 1; 0, 1, 0; 0, 1,
1; 1, 0, 0; 1, 0, 1.
Or rather, the basis states are this.
And this is a bit where the first two qubits are 1.

And you have, I believe, a minus i there when
the first two qubits are 1.
So if you could apply the circuit that
multiplies by i when the first two qubits are 1,
which is this guy on the first two qubits--
0, 0; 0, 1; 1, 0; 1 1--

then this will cancel out this.

So up to here--
Well, actually, we need to put this H on the left here.
So up to there gives you this circuit, or this gate,
which is exactly what we want, except it has a minus i here.
This minus i happens whenever both the first two qubits
are 1.
So we can cancel it by applying an i when the first two
qubits are 1, and this gate we can do just on the circuits
are the first two qubits.
[INAUDIBLE]
So this is another example of back action, in that you would
think that this doesn't do anything for the first two
qubits, but it actually changes the phase of them
under certain circumstances.
It doesn't change 0, 0; 0, 1; 1, 0; or 1, 1 values,
because in the classical--
You know, if you look at the classical basis values,
none of these operations change it.
But it does change the , phases and we need to undo all those
phase changes.
