The continued fraction algorithm.
So what we have is we have z over 2 to the 2l is
a approximately on d over r.
And we want d over r.

And we also know r is much smaller than 2 to the 2l.
So first, let's think about this in terms of information.
How much information is there?
How much information in z?
Well, the answer is 2l bits.

How much in d r?
log d plus log r, that's roughly.
So what we need is we need r to be-- or we need 2 to the 2l
to be roughly r squared.
And in fact, we're going to show it works as long as 2 to the 2l
is bigger than 4 r squared.

So this 2l for a l bit long number--
if we want to factor an l bit long number,
we need 2l registers for the function and another l
registers for the result of the function.

OK.
So continued fraction is an algorithm
which finds all good approximation to a real number.

Finds all good approximations.

Where there's a technical definition
of good approximation we won't use.
And what is it?

Let's say r equals 15 and we get 887 over 1,024.
So this was the output of our quantum computer,
and this was 2l where we're using
2l bit register for the quantum Fourier transform.

So this is equal to 0.86621.
The first thing we do is we take this number
and we write it in continued fraction form.

Equals 1 over 1 plus 1 over 6 plus 1 over 2 plus 1 over 9
plus 1 over 3 plus 1.
So 887 equals that.
And the continued fraction is 1, 6, 2, 9, 3, 2.
So just these pieces of the numerator of the continued
for--
pieces of the denominator of the continued fraction.

So how do we do this?

It's actually pretty easy.

And I'll just do it by example.
.86621 equals 1 over 1 plus 0.154454.
So we divide 1 by this number and we get 1 plus a remainder.
So 1 over this is 1 plus 0.1546
Well, this is equal to--
well, we're going to do the same thing.
We take 1 and divide it by this number and we get 6.
1 plus 1 over 6 plus 0.4744.
And you can guess what we're going to do next time,
we're going to take 1 and divide it by this.
And that's equal to 1 over 1 plus 1 over 6 plus 1 over 2
plus 0.1079, etc.
And we keep on doing this.
Well, either until-- well, in this case,
we can keep on doing this until we
reach the actual rational number 887 over 1,024.
Yeah?
As you progress through the continued fraction chain,
will these always be underestimates?
No, they're going to alternate being under and over.

Well, actually all of these things are exact.
This is equal to this is equal to this is equal to that
because I've added this thing.
But as you can guess, the convergence are--

first convergent is 1.
Second is 1 over 1 plus 1 over 6.
That equals 0.8571.
That's under.
The next 1 over 1 plus 1 over 6 plus 1/2.
That equals 13 over 15.
And that's 0.86667.
And the next one is 1 plus 1 over 1 plus 1 over 6
plus 1 over 2 plus 1 for 9.
So we're just taking the first few things of that.
That is equal to 123 over 142 equals 0.866197.
And I'm not going to go through any more of them.
But you can see that this first one is over,
the second was under, third is an overestimate,
but it's getting much closer.
The fourth is an underestimate, and it's really, really close.
So those are the convergence of the continued fraction.
And I should say the continue fraction is guaranteed to find
all good approximations where--
there is a technical term for what a good proclamation is
and it's not quite what you might think it is.

and
If you choose 2 to the 2l is roughly bigger
than the maximum possible period squared,
the right answer is guaranteed to be a good approximation.
But I'm not going to prove either of these
because proving it finds all can be good approximations is
a little bit tricky and proving that it actually
is a good approximation, this technical term,
is also a little bit tricky.
Although, maybe I should write down what
a good approximation is.
Q over r is a good approximation to x.

Let's make d over a is good approximation to x
if d x, minus r is less than a c x minus q for all integers--
for all c q less than r.

Well, for all c and for all q less than r.
So if q is less than r, you could not
get as good approximation for d x minus r.
So this is what it means to be a good approximation
for the continued [INAUDIBLE].
