So suppose you can get a toffoli gate.

OK, so later I will tell you how to get a toffoli gate out
of this set of gates.
Then you can get any permutation gate.

So let's say use of f--
no, let's say use of pi of 0100 equals pi 0100.
And pi is a permutation on strings of te bits.

So why is this?
Well, let's see.

OK, so a permutation gate, if you look at its matrix,
just has 1's and 0's, and there's a 1 in every row
and a 1 in every column.
So this is a permutation matrix.

And it's essentially a classical computation function.

What did I call this?
Use of pi.
So pi maps x to y, xy classical bit strings.

And, in fact, it's a reversible classical function.
And Professor Truong explained why
toffoli gates were universal for reversible classical functions.
So if you have a toffoli gate, then you
can get any permutation gate.
