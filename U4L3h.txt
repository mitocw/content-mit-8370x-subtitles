So let S be the set of bits--
the set of Alice's strings that have r in their row--

r in their row.
So this is the set of Alice's strings,
such if Bob makes the responses that are in r,
Alice will make her half of the conversation in r.

And let t set of Bob's strings that have r in their column.

So let's pretend that Alice's strings are like this
and Bob's strings are like this, even though they're not
actually going to be gathered together.
Then r-- was I--
I think I want to make this a little r.

Then any time Alice has some string in this set
and Bob has some string in this set,
then the conversation between Alice and Bob
will be r because the set S of strings
is a set of strings, which Alice makes the conversation
r as long as Bob sticks with his half of the dialogue.
And t is a set of strings for which Bob makes the responses
in r as long as Alice sticks to her half of the dialogue.
And any string in any s and s and t and t will give you r.

But now I want to claim s times t is bigger than 2 to the 0.99n
times 2 to the 0.99 n, because if you look at the diagonal-
if you look at the intersection of the diagonal of this
rectangle, there are at least 2 to the 0.99n things on that
intersection because this conversation r appeared
on the diagonal 2 the 0.99n times.
And this just happens to be 4 to the 0.99n.
But now we have the size of s times the size of--
[INAUDIBLE]

The size of s times the size of t is bigger than 4
to the 0.96n, which means there is some s in s and t in t that
differ by--

with Hamming distance exactly n over 2--
implies there exists an s in s, t in t,
or maybe I should say s star, such
that the Hamming distance between s star t star
is equal to n over 2.

And if Alice starts with s star and Bob starts with t star,
they have--
they have this conversation r, and we know this conversation
r ends with Alice saying the strings are equal,
because the--
well, we can just say 1, 0 means strings equal.
We can have that as the last message in the conversation.

So this shows that any protocol for any classical protocol
for Deutsch-Josza needs to have more than n over 100 bits
if you encode the--

enlarge the encoding to be something
like this, which means it has to have, at most, more than n
over 200 bits in the original message [INAUDIBLE]..

So that is the proof that classical Deutsch-Josza
deterministically with the exact answer takes at least n
over 200 bit messages.
And we know that quantum Deutsch-Jozsa can be done
in log n messages by the--
the exact quantum Deutsch-Josza can be done in log n messages
by the protocol I gave you last time.
