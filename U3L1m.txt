So what I want to tell you now is
how to compute the error from the syndrome
here, and then tell you what a general Hamming
code, a general classical Hamming code, looks like.
So how do you compute the error from the [INAUDIBLE]??
Well, in this case, it's really easy.
eh is 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, where this is in sum position times
h.
Well, this is a row of h.
So suppose you get 0, 1, 1, has your syndrome.
You can go to your matrix h and look at all the rows of it,
and figure out which one it matches.

So if this is in the ith place, this is the ith bit of h.

OK, I think I have time to give an example.

m equals 1, 1, 0, 1.
We multiply that by G. mG is equal to 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0.

And mG plus e is equal to--
do any of you have a favorite position to make the error in?
5.
5.
1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0.

mG plus e times h.
We want to sum up the first, second, fourth, fifth,
and sixth rows of h, so first, second.

So this is just a 1 in the last one.
The fourth is 0, 1, 0.
The fifth is 1, 1, 0 and 1, 0, 0.
So this is equal to 1, 0, 0, which is the fifth row of mG.
