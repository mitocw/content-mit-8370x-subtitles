I still need to show you how to get factoring
from order finding.
So first, let me say the second fastest classical algorithm is
the quadratic sieve.

So as like most classical algorithms.

So suppose you have an N equal P times Q. Actually,
they work in more general cases, but we'll just worry
about the case of two primes.

So the first step--

actually this is, really, the only step.
The trick is to bind x squared congruent to y
squared mod N. x not congruent to plus or minus y mod N.
So suppose you're trying to factor 21.
You get 4 square equals 25--
I'm sorry, not 4.
4 is congruent to 25 mod 21, right?
Because 25 minus 4 is about 21.

No, wait.

Is this going to work?
Yes, it's going to work.

So 4-- these are both squares.

And now, we have 5 minus 2 times 5 plus 2 is congruent to 0 mod
21.

And whenever this happens, one of these
contains P and the other contains Q. Or rather
whenever these are not--
whenever neither of these is 0, you
have a product of two numbers, which is zero mod 21.
And so we know that the product has to contain 3 somewhere
and it has to contain [INAUDIBLE] somewhere.
And if neither of these factors is 0 mod 21,
3 has to be contained in one factor, and 7 in the other.
And then what you can do is you can use Euclid's Algorithm.

Algorithm 4 gcd to get P and Q. So whenever
you get two squares which are equal to each other,
you're essentially done.

And this is how the quadratic sieve works,
and that's the second fastest classical factoring
algorithm known.
And how do we find a x squared, x squared?

Well, let's look at the function f of x equals g to the x mod N.
So this is periodic because f g to the r is congruent to 1,
then g to be x plus r is congruent to g to the x mod N
because if g to the r is congruent to 1,
then g to the x plus r congruent to g to the x,
because it just nullify both sides of this by g to the x.
So that says that f of x is periodic.
I mean, it has to start repeating some time
because there are only N possible things here.
And whenever it starts repeating,
you get a g to the x plus r congruent to g to the x.
And that means g to the r is congruent to 1.
Good, so that works.
So g to the r over 2 squared is congruent to 1
squared if r is even.

So let's do an example.

Suppose we're trying to factor 21.
One, so 2 to the 0 will go first, 2 squared, et cetera.
So this is 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32.
32 minus 21 is 11, so the next element is 11.
And 22 minus 21 is 1, 1.
So 2 to the 6th is congruent to 1 mod 21.
That means 2, 2 cubed is congruent to--
or rather 2 cubed minus 1 times 2
cubed plus 1 is congruent to 0 mod 21.
And this is 7, and this is 9.
And 7 contains the factor 7.
9 contains the factor 3.

So the question is, how can this go wrong?

Well, there is a couple of things that could go wrong.

We could have started with 4.

4, 4, 16.
16 squared-- well, we to 2 to the 6th is congruent to 1 mod
21, so 4 cubed is congruent to 1 mod 21.
So we get 4 cubed is congruent to 1 mod 21.
4 to the 3/2 doesn't exist.
Well, we can't compute it.

So this shows that 4 cold go wrong.
The other thing that could go wrong is we could do this
and when we look at the middle element, it's minus 1.

That would be a problem because then we
have x is equal to minus y mod N, and we can't use that.
We can't use this trick then.
So some things can go wrong, but the great theorem,
which is not too hard to prove using number theory,
but which is too hard to prove in a single hour
and a half session when I have way too much other stuff
to cover, is probability of success.

What is the sequence g to the x is
greater than or equal to 1/2 for a random g between 0.
For a random g less than N. So you choose a random g
less than N. You do this repeated squaring,
and the probability this will work is at least 1/2.
And if it doesn't work, you choose another random g.
So eventually, with high probability,
you will get a g which lets you factor.

OK, so there's two more things I have to do.
I have to go back to [INAUDIBLE] fractions,
and I haven't told you how to compute g to the x.
