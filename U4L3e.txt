We can ask what happens with quantum.
So what we're going to show is that this entry is log n.
So here we get an exponential advantage
for quantum fingerprinting over classical fingerprinting.

And of course, quantum fingerprinting cannot do any
better than O 1.
And I don't know what quantum fingerprinting can
do in the deterministic case.

So, we're going to do the same thing,
we're going to use the same error correcting code.
Alice and Bob are going to each prepare a quantum state.
Prepare a quantum state.

And Alice prepares, well this is a two-end bit error correcting
code, so let's say i equals 1 through 2n square root of 2n
E--

i E sub i.

Bob prepares one of root 2n sum i equals 1 through 2n.
i, E sub i.
And I should say this is the encoding of Alice's x1,
and this is encoding of Bob's x2.

So these are the fingerprints.

x1 equals x2.

Let's give these names, psi1 and psi2.

psi1 and psi2 is equal to 1.

If x1 is not equal to x2, psi1 psi2 is equal to sum.
Well, they're summing from 1 through 2n, so 1 over 2n sum i
equals 1 through 2n.
And you want to take the inner product of this with this.
So i i E ia and E ib.

So when you take the inner product of this with this,
if the values of i here are different
in the first register, the inner product is 0,
so you only need to worry about the ones where they're equal.
And that's E ia and E ib.
And we know from this error correcting code,
that at most 29/30 of the bits are equal.
So this is less than or equal to 29/30.
