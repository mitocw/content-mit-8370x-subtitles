What we're going to do is we're going to show that continued
fractions actually--
if we're within 1 over r squared,
the continued fractions will actually
find the right fraction.
So how do we do this?

Well, let's consider continued fraction expansions of x.
So here is x.
If x equals-- what?
Let's see x, x.
If x equals d over r, well, we get the right answer
because one of the convergence of any rational number
in the continued fraction is the rational number itself.

Get the right answer.

So here is d over r.

For sum interval around d over r, also get the right answer.

| mean, that's actually pretty easy
to prove because it's obvious that continued fractions are
continuous process.
So if you alter x by a small enough amount then d over
r will be one of the convergence.

Let's do this for 13/15.

So what was it?
13/15 was equal to 1 over 1 plus 1 over 6 plus 1 over 2.
1 over 1 plus 1 over 6 plus 1 over 2.

So let's look at 1 over 1 plus 1 over 6 plus 1 over 2
plus epsilon.

Epsilon is bigger than 1.

Sorry, I want to say if epsilon is less than 1,
still get 13 over 15 as a convergent.
Why is that?
Well, if epsilon is less than 1, then you
do this them plus 1 over whatever plus 1 over whatever,
et cetera.
So if epsilon is less than 1, the continued fraction
starts out like this and then keeps on going.

And if epsilon is bigger than minus 1/2, we still get 13/15.
Why is that?
Well, if epsilon is bigger than minus 1/2,
you get 1 over 1 over 6 plus 1 over 1 plus 1 over 1 plus dot,
dot, dot.
And 1 plus 1 over is just equal to 1 over 2.
So if you cut it off here, it's still 13/15.

Is that clear?

And why bigger than minus 1/2?
Well, if what you had was 1 over 3/2, it would be 1 over 1
plus 1/2 plus more terms, but we can ignore them
because this is 13/15.

OK.

So what is 1 over 1 plus 1 over 6 plus 1 over 2 plus epsilon?

Well, this is clearly a fraction with epsilon in it.
And it has to be of the form--
well, I'll tell you what it is first.
And then I'll tell you why it has to be of this form.
It's 13 plus 6 epsilon over 15 plus 7 epsilon.

So it has to be of form a plus epsilon over c plus d epsilon
because if you stick that in there
and then keep on doing these operations--
you know, 1 over 1 plus g preserves
something of that form.
So it has to look like this.
I mean, it has to be a plus b epsilon over c plus d epsilon.
Now, when epsilon equals 0, we know it's 13/15.
And did anybody notice that this was 6/7?
So 6/7 is the convergent before that.
And if you plug in epsilon equals infinity, well.
What does that do?
It gets rid of this last term, so you get the convergent
before that.
So you get 6/7.

So this is 13 plus 6 epsilon over 15 plus seven epsilon.
And when we go back here and we have 13/15,
the number ahead of that is 20 over 23.
The number behind that is 19 over 22.
And you can see the difference between these
is from 1 over 15 times 22.
And the difference between these is 1 over 15 times 23.

And well, this is r.
This is actually less than 2r because it
was 15 plus 7 times 1.
And when you substitute in epsilon equals minus 1/2,
then this has to be less than 3r.
So this number is less than 2 r squared and this
is less than 3 r squared.
So as long as you're within 1 over three,
r squared of d over r--
one of your convergence will be the right answer.

And actually I think the textbook
has a proof of 1 over 2 r squared,
But this is good enough.

So that tells you that you choose l,
you twice as many bits.
Or rather 2l, your first register
that you're using for the Fourier transform
have to have twice the number of bits
as the number you're trying to factor,
and you're guaranteed to get d over r as one
