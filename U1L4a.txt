OK.
So last time we went over the Bloch sphere, and Pauli gates,
and other stuff.
So I will redraw the Bloch sphere.

So this point was 0, this point was 1,
and there is notation widely used in quantum computing
that says this point is plus and this point is minus.
So plus is equal to 1 over root 2 0 plus 1,
and minus is 1 over root 2 0 minus 1.

And this was 0 plus i 1 normalized.
And this was 0 minus i 1 normalized.

And last time, we talked about how
to rotate the Bloch sphere around the x-axis, the y-axis,
and the z-axis.
So we got x, y, and I can't reach z, but it's up.

So we didn't talk about measurement last time.
And I'm going to say a little bit about measurement
this time, because I'm going to need it
