A key thing about quantum simulations
is exactly those errors, which I've
swept under the rug with this simple discussion
of a particle and a potential.
Let me now illustrate the role of those errors
in looking at the performance of an algorithm
that you're familiar with.
That will be Grover's algorithm.

So recall what Grover's algorithm does.
With Grover's algorithm, you're given an oracle
which takes in some value x and some scratchpad y,
acquires an oracle function, leaving x unchanged
and giving you y [? XORed ?] with f of x.
And the idea is that f of x is equal to 1
for a single marked element and 0 otherwise.

This is the bit-flip oracle we've used,
but you may also have instead the phase-flip oracle, where
x goes to minus x only for that marked element
and is unchanged otherwise.

And your goal is to find x0, given the oracle.
All right.
And remember how we did this.
Grover's algorithm can actually be summarized very, very
succinctly.
We say that the algorithm is just the application
of a Grover iterate a certain number of times.

So call this psi sub k, G to the k, where G is equal to nothing
more than this funny operator that Grover came up with.

This O will be the oracle operation
in this phase-flip formulation.
And psi, here, is the superposition
over all uniform basis states.
[INAUDIBLE] apply to every qubit,
if you're working in the qubit picture.

Or, if you're not working in the qubit picture,
just a uniform superposition over all states.
So capital N will be the size of the domain we are searching.
