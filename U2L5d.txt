OK, so first I'll do the intuition
and then I'll do the math.
So it's a geometric sum and it's a whole bunch of points
around the unit circle.
So we start with e to the minus 2 pi i x zero.
Let's plots these points--
e to the minus 2 pi i x zero.
And now we go yr over--
I'm sorry rz over 2 to the 2l.
So the next one we want to plot is y equals 1.
So we go some distance around the circle.
And let's plot another point.
And then we plot another point.
Another point.
Another point.
We keep on going.

And what we get is quite possibly
points that are nearly, exactly, uniformly
distributed over the unit circle.

Sum close to zero unless well, unless what happens is--
what's here?
Here was e to the 2 pi i x zero.
I should divide by 2 to do that.
2 to the 2l.

And here is e to the 2 pi i.

e to the minus 2 pi i x 0 plus.
Y equals 1 here.
r-- oh I forgot z here.
z over 2 to the 2 l.

So unless what happens is when we plot the point,
we move around by the angle 2 pi i rz over 2 to the 2l.
Suppose this angle is tiny.
Well what happens then is we get points uniformly distributed.
Suppose it's tiny enough so that when we add all of these 2
to the l over r points we get points
that are an arc, which doesn't even go
all the way around the circle.

Sum is close to well how many points were there?
There were 2 the 2l over r.
And they were all pointing in more or less
the same direction.
So in absolute value.

So there's two cases here.

2 pi rz over 2 to the 2l is close to 1, which means y--
no sorry rz over 2 to the 2l is close to an integer.
If rz over 2 the 2l is close to integer,
and let's call that integer d.

So if this is close to integer, then we
get a large probability of seeing this.
If it's not close to an integer, we
get a tiny probability of seeing that.

So now what I'm trying to do is actually do the geometric sum.
So the geometric sum is 1 minus e 2 pi i.
We want the last term of the sum.
That's 2 to the 2 l rz over 2 the 2 l.

No it's y goes from 1 to 2 to the 2l over r.
So the last term you substitute in 2 to the 2 l r over z.
So something like 2 to the 2 l over r.
And we have to take the floor of that times r times z over 2
to the the 2l.
Which really, because of this floor
could be anywhere on the unit circle.
But it's always less than two in absolute value.
And we're dividing that by 1 minus either 2pi i to the 2 l
over r.
No, we leave that term out.
rz over 2 to the 2l.

And remember the sum is really--
so we're dividing something by something else.
And it's going to be relatively small, unless the something
else we're dividing is really really, really close to zero.
So this is roughly something O 1 divided by what is this?
This Is roughly r z over 2 to the 2l.
So the probability of seeing a number z
is roughly r z over 2 to the 2 l squared minus d,
because d was our integer.
So we have d over r is roughly z over 2 to the 2l.

So what our algorithm does is it outputs z.
We know 2 to the 2l.
And we need to round it off to something like d over r.
And there is a procedure for rounding numbers--
rounding real numbers of two smaller fractions,
that is efficient.
And it's called continued fractions,
and we'll talk about that later.
But it's a classical algorithm.
So once we get this, we can round it to d over r.
And then we found r, which was the period we were looking for.
