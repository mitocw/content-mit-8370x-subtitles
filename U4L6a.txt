Simulation of physical systems is a generic challenge
that is well known across a wide variety of fields.
I want to illustrate the simulation challenge to you
today with one very specific thing.
And then I'll broaden, from that.
And this specific thing has to do with a well-known task known
as "nitrogen fixation."

And nitrogen fixation is a process
that happens in nature that involves
taking gaseous nitrogen from the atmosphere
and then combining that with protons,
typically from water, and then producing, as a result of this,
two molecules of ammonia.
Of course, in natural systems, in biological systems,
this is not usually ammonia but probably ammonium.
And yet this is one of the most important processes
to biological systems, including your life and my life,
because it is the rate of this nitrogen-fixation process that
limits the production, for example, of food.
And the reason this is such an important and interesting
reaction can be illustrated by looking at the reaction
diagram of the process.
So let this be a reaction coordinate.
So, progress as the reaction proceeds,
from the left-hand side to the right-hand side
of this equation.
And the fact is that the reactants coming in
have a certain kind of energy.
And let me not be too specific about that,
but they have to overcome an enormous activation energy
barrier before being able to exit the reaction as a product,
the ammonia that we have here.
This energy difference, here, is on the order of 50 kilojoules
per mole of the reactants.
This energy activation barrier, here,
is much higher, on the order of 400 kilojoules per mole.
And so, although it's desirable to be
able to fixate nitrogen and produce ammonia, you have to--
at least, if you have no other recourse--
supply a great deal of energy before you
can get this recovery of energy, since this
is an endothermic reaction.

So, many of you may not know, but we have
a lot of nitrogens in our body.
Almost all of the--
50% of the nitrogens in your body,
according to an article in Nature in the early 2000s,
comes from a single chemical process.
And it's remarkable for me to realize and appreciate
that so much of ourselves, our bodies, our nitrogen,
is dependent on this process known
as the Haber-Bosch process.

Circa 1911, and Fritz Haber and Bosch won Nobel prizes
for their work in this area, this
is a process which creates ammonia from nitrogen
and steam, by cracking it.
And so it utilizes a metal catalyst
at a very high temperature and pressure, 200 megapascals,
and something like 450 degrees Celsius,
in a very large-scale industrial process,
to be able to generate ammonia.
And what is the ammonia then used for?
It turns out that it is used for fertilizer.

And that fertilizer then goes into you, the human body.

And we can estimate that it probably
is responsible for something on the order
of the sustenance of maybe 40% of the world population.

Enormous industrial-scale production.
And, at the same time, the cost is between 1% and 2%
of the world's energy.

OK.
Now, this is fascinating.
It's a strange place perhaps to be
talking about and starting a lecture on quantum computation.
But here's the idea.
Nitrogen fixation is not done by nature
using the Haber-Bosch process, using
this very high-temperature, very high-pressure
industrial process.
Instead, nature does it with catalysts--
not metal catalysts, but biological catalysts
which are enzymes--
for example, in bacteria--
at room temperature and at room pressure.
And it does it in a remarkably different way which
we do not understand today.
And the example of how this is done
is with a special enzyme known as "nitrogenase."

And this is a bacteria enzyme, one of many different kinds
of enzymes which are able to fixate nitrogen
from the atmosphere and turn it into ammonium and ammonia.
But what is remarkable about this enzyme
is that we do not understand, today, how and why it works.
Maybe on the order of a dozen other kinds
of varieties of biological enzymes
have been manufactured or extracted,
to accomplish the same tasks that the Haber-Bosch process
does, but none of them are quite stable and efficient
and long-running as what happens in biology today.
Now, the reason we don't understand this
is because this is all happening in a complex molecule.
The actual reaction which I wrote over
there involves much more than just nitrogen and two
molecules of water or hydrogen coming in, to give you--

let's balance our reaction, over here.
There are many other things that are happening
inside these processes.
For example, there are eight protons and eight electrons
that come in, typically.
And this may also involve, for example, a proton
pump with adenosine triphosphate,
losing phosphorus to become, on the other side, 16 ADP and 16
phosphorus, like this.
So, nature uses a very small amount of energy
to be able to catalyze this and take
this nitrogen-fixation reaction over the activation energy
barrier.
Now, why is this possible?
It turns out there is this amazing center
inside this nitrogenase, called the "iron molybdenum complex."

And it has on the order of 100 kilodaltons of atoms
inside this.
So we're talking on the order of maybe 1,000 carbon atoms.
And they're all shaped in various ways,
with alpha helices and beta sheets.
And these shapes then allow the nitrogen and the hydrogen
coming in to dock in a certain way.
And then, because of where they're docked,
they can react and do so much more efficiently than they
are able to do in this heterogeneous type
of catalytic reaction that's industrially done.
So we would love to, in quantum chemistry,
synthesize molecules which have such functionality.
Because you could catalyze all sorts of other reactions.
We cannot understand why this is happening,
from a fundamental standpoint, today,
because we do not know what is happening
in a quantum-mechanical way with this molecule.
Only very recently was even the structure
of the molecule understood-- like,
with X-ray crystallography and the like.
So we, in principle, could do so.
In fact, in principle we can write down--
in principle, we can write down all
we need in order to figure out what's
happening in this, because the system is actually
a very simple Hamiltonian, in principle.
There is the kinetic energy of the nucleons.
There is the kinetic energy of the electrons.
And then there are interaction terms, between the nucleons
and nucleons, between the nucleons and the electrons,
and the electrons and the electrons.
And I'll expand into this Hamiltonian in a little bit,
to show you concretely what this means, but suffice
to say that we can write down a very accurate description
of the system.
What we cannot do, what we do not know how to do,
is to solve for things like the reaction rate and, even more
simply, just the ground state of the system.

So at least we would like to know
the ground state of the system.

We would also like to know the eigenstates.

And then we would like to put these
all into reaction surfaces which allow
us to tell about what the chemistry of the molecule
is going to be.
How is it going to react, and why?
Now, in principle this is something
that a quantum computer can tell us,
in a way which is fascinatingly different.
So, as Peter Shor told you about, in 1985
Richard Feynman observed that quantum computers in principle
are capable of simulating physical systems much more
efficiently, faster than classical computers can.
Fundamentally, this is because the quantum computer
is executing the same dynamics as the quantum system
that you're interested in solving and simulating.
And then the challenge is to take that quantum dynamics
of your quantum computer and map those
into the quantum dynamics of the system
that you would like to simulate.
And so what I want to tell you today is how that is done,
what the challenges are, and what the opportunities are
