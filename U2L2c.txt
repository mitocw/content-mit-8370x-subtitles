And now let's think about how to do this for the two-bit qubit
case.
We have 0,0, 0,1 1,0 1,1.
OK.
So what I want to do now is I want
to define a slightly different definition of oracle.
And here, a definition of quantum oracle.

Here you're going to put an x.

And you're going to get minus 1 to the f of x times x.
So this quantum oracle changes the phase of the input
if f of x is 1.
And it doesn't change the phase if f of x is 0.

And we will later see why these two different definitions
of oracle are actually equivalent.
But right now, I want to say, well,
how would you solve this problem with f
of x being a quantum oracle?

OK, well, what we're going to do is we're going to input 0,0
plus 1,1 plus 0,1 plus 1,0 plus 1,1.
So what we're doing right now is solving the two-qubit David
Joseph problem.
So output case a might be 1/2 0,0 plus 0,1 plus 1,0 plus 1,1.
Or it might be minus that.
But these are the only two things
that will be output if f is constant.
If f is constant and equal to 1, you'll output this.
And case b, where it's balanced, the output would be 1/2 0,0
minus 0,1 plus 1,0 minus 1,1.
Or something like that.
Now can anybody tell me how to distinguish between these two
possibilities?

Well, what we want to do is make a measurement.
And we want to have the measurement
to be yes in this case and no in this case.
Yeah?
[INAUDIBLE] to 0?
Very, very good.
Actually, you have to apply two Hadamard digs and test for 0,
but yeah.

And applying a Hadamard gate and testing for 0--
So what we're going to do is we're
going to put in plus-plus, the phase
oracle, Hadamard-Hadamard, and measure-measure.

If output equals 0,0--

Well, if the output equals 0,0 this is constant--
or, I should say, at this constant.
If output is not equal to 0,0, f is balanced.
Why is that?

Well, applying two Hadamard gates--

Two Hadamard gates measures in basis 0,0 0,1--
oh wait.

Plus-plus equals 0,0 plus 0,1 plus 1,0 plus 1,1.
Plus-minus equals 1/2 0,0 minus 0,1
plus 1,0 minus 1,1, et cetera.
So minus-minus equals 1/2 0,0 minus 0,1 minus 1,0 plus 1,1.
OK?

So if f is this, or negative plus-plus,
the outcome output will be plus-plus.
If f is any balanced function, the output
will be plus-minus, minus-plus, or minus-minus, depending
on which function it is.
And of course, measuring applying a Hadamard
and then measuring in the 0,1 basis
is the same as measuring in the spaces.
