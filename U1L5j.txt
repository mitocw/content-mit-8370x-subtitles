Recall in the first lecture I said, if you could clone,
then you could communicate faster than light.

Then, communicate.

And this was--
Herbert called this FLASH, this is for laser amplified--

first laser amplified superluminal hookup.
And what I'm going to do is basically
go through his paper, although I'm simplifying some things.
This is essentially the argument of his paper.

And the reason he thought you could clone
is if you look at a high level description of how
a laser works, it seems like it should
be able to clone photons.
It can't, but that apparently wasn't
clear to any of the referees, because they couldn't figure
out the flaw in the paper.
So what we do we do.
We take the state 0 1 plus 1 0 and distribute it
between Alice and Bob.

Alice measures her qubit in either 0 1 basis or plus minus
basis.

Good.

So let's see.
I think I need another board to show what happens.

Unless
Alice, 0 1, plus minus.

Bob-- well, if Alice measures her qubit and she gets 0,
then Bob has 1.
If she gets 1, he has 0.
So Bob gets 0, probability 1/2, 1, probability 1/2.
And here gets plus with probability 1/2,
minus, with probability 1/2.
Bob now clones his qubit.

And I will use this notation as saying,
this is a very suspect step.
So now he has 0 0 with probability 1/2 and 1 1
with probability 1/2.
And over here he has plus plus with probability 1/2,
minus minus with probability 1/2.

And now, what Bob is going to do is
he's going to measure both qubits in the same basis.

OK.
So if he measures in bases 0 1, he
gets 0 0 with probability 1/2 and 1 1 with probability 1/2.

If he measures in the bases plus minus,
well, if you measure 0 in the basis plus minus,
you're equally likely to get a plus or a minus.
What you get is plus minus, plus minus, minus plus, minus minus,
each with probability 1/4.
And over here, if he measures in 0 1,
he gets 0 0, 0 1, 1 0, 1 1, with probability 1/4.

And over here, if he measures in plus minus,
he gets plus plus with probability 1/2.
And because if he got plus plus and he
measured in the plus minus basis,
he would get both quibits plus.
And same-- let me repeat.
That minus minus and he measured it in the plus minus basis,
both of them would come out minus.
Minus minus, with probability 1/2.

So you see, Bob get something different
depending on whether Alice measured in the 0 1
basis or the plus minus basis.
And if Alice does something and Bob gets--
Alice sends a signal and Bob receives
the signal and the signal is different
depending on what Alice did, they
can use that to communicate.
So what does this mean?
Well, this means that 0 with probability 1/2 and 1
with probability 1/2--

so this is one ensemble of states--
and another ensemble of states plus with profitability 1/2
and minus with probability 1/2, these two ensembles
must be indistinguishable.

And there's a problem on the homework
that's related to this.
But here we have--
Alice can either measure in the 0 1 basis and the plus minus
basis.
If she measures in the 0 1 basis,
Bob gets this ensemble of quantum states.
If she measures in the plus minus basis,
he gets this ensemble.
And because Bob and Alice can share entangled qubit
and then Alice can measure, or rather
Alice can measure her half and Bob
can measure his half at exactly the same time,
regardless of how much distance there is between them, then
if there was some way of Bob distinguishing
between this ensemble of quantum states
and this ensemble of quantum states,
Alice and Bob could send a signal faster than light.

And we know that's impossible.
Well, we know that should be impossible from relativity.
And this is why Herbert's FLASH scheme failed.
But in failing, it did something very
useful in that it provided an opportunity for two
other groups to prove that quantum cloning is impossible.
So are there any questions?

Yeah.
When you say, these two ensembles
must be indistinguishable, is this
a conclusion from the fact that this scheme fails,
or is this a conclusion that's required for this scheme
to work?
It's a conclusion from the fact that the scheme has to fail,
because Alice can give Bob this ensemble by measuring in a 0 1
basis, and Alice can give Bob this ensemble by measuring
the plus minus basis.
And Bob should not be able to tell these apart,
because then Alice could communicate the signal to him
faster than light.
Yeah?
Could you go over again why the cloning is
necessary in order for him to distinguish what Alice--
Well, here he has two copies of the quantum state,
rather than one copy of the quantum state.
And so, I mean, if we just had one copy of the quantum state
and did the same--
you know.
So let's see.
0 1.

And he measures in 0 1, 0 1 basis,
he gets 0 with probability 1/2 and 1 with probability 1/2,
because he measures the state perfectly.
And in either case--
but he had these two things with probability 1/2.
Now, if he measures in the plus minus basis,
he gets plus with probability 1/2
and minus with probability of 1/2,
because if you measure 0 and the plus minus basis,
it has an equal probability of giving you a plus
and giving you a minus, because 0 equals 1 over root 2
plus plus minus.
And 1 equals 1/2 plus minus minus.
And if you measure this in the plus minus basis,
you get plus with probably 1/2 and minus with probability 1/2.
So it doesn't matter.
If you can't duplicate these steps,
then he will get plus with probability 1/2 and minus
with probability 1/2, regardless of whether he has signal--
or rather, whether his ensemble is 0 1 or plus minus.

So in order to use this to distinguish them,
he has to be able to clone.
Because here, when he cloned this 0 1 qubit,
they were always the same.
But if he only has one qubit, he can't test whether both of them
were the same.

This is why this faster than light scheme did not work.

And the real reason it didn't work
is because lasers didn't work the way he thought he did.
But that was actually a rather subtle point,
because none of the referees, obviously,
knew how lasers worked, or they would have rejected this paper.
And then, the no cloning theorem would have taken another five
years to be discovered.
Yeah?
Sorry.
Can I just clarify, what exactly is the information
that is being sent?
The information being sent is which basis Alice measured in.
So she can either measure in the plus
minus 1 basis, in which case she gets a random output,
or she can measure in the plus minus basis, in which case
she gets a different random output.
