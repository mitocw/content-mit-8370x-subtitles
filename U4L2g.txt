Grover's algorithm-- find marked set,
and we have an oracle that takes.

Actually, we want to find an element of the mark set,
and we have an oracle that takes xb to xb plus f of x.
f of x equals 1 if x is marked and 0 if x not marked.

And this takes root s time.

So again, we're going to use Bob as an oracle.

So what do we do?
Well, we have Alice has k possible dates,
and let's call these set SA.

Alice prepares summation i in SA ib.

Sends to Bob.

Well, actually this is going to be 0.

Actually, it might be easier if we--

no, let's do it this way.
i0 sends to Bob.

Bob sends back i--

well, 1 if x is in SB, 0 if x is not in SB.

And he does this, again, coherently
by doing control not from the index i into this register.

So I'm going to claim this is a Grover oracle for Alice,
because Bob tells Alice if the set is marked
or if the set is not marked, or if the element x is marked--
or rather, this is i, not x--
Bob tells Alice whether the element i is marked
or the element i is not marked.

And now Alice has applied Grover's oracle.
And if Alice can apply--
use Bob as a Grover oracle, she can just
run Grover's algorithm, and every time Grover's algorithm
says, call the oracle, she just sends a message to Bob,
and he sends a message back to her.
And actually, I should say she sends it to B,
and this is 1 plus B--
or 1 exclusive [? rB ?] if I is an S, and B if I is not an S.
So she can do Grover's oracle by sending
one message of login bits to Bob and him sending it back.
So Grover's oracle requires root k time
to identify a marked element.
So Alice's algorithm-- Alice's distributed quantum algorithm
requires root k time to identify a marked element,
and a marked element is clearly an [? outside ?] set of SA.
And because it's marked, it's in Bob's SB.

so this is distributed disjointedness.
