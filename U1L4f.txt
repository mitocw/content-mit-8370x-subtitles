So tensor products of vectors.

Let's go over it again.
We have alpha, beta, tensor, gamma, delta.
And now these-- we should give these coordinates a name.
This is 0, 1, and this is 0, 1.
This product of these is, well, we
have to put these coordinates in some order.
And the easiest order to put them in is lexicographic order.
And, in fact, if the tensor product is--
if we do if we don't say anything
about the order of the coordinates in the tensor
product, they'll just be in lexicographic order.
And that's just-- well, 0, 0 0, 1 is alpha delta.
1, 0 is beta gamma.
And 1, 1 is beta delta.
